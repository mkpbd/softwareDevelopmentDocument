Adding an attribute
To add an attribute to our page, we can use the attribute directive:
@attribute [Authorize]


[Authorize] public partial class SomeClass {}

Adding an interface
To implement an interface (IDisposable in this case), we would use the following code:
@implements IDisposable


public partial class SomeClass : IDisposable {}


Inheriting
To inherit another class, we should use the following code:
@inherits TypeNameOfClassToInheritFrom

To do the same in a code-behind scenario, we would add the class we want to inherit from after
the class name:
public class SomeClass : TypeNameOfClassToInheritFrom {}



Generics
We can define our component as a generic component.
Generics allow us to define the data type, so the component works with any data type.
To define a component as a generic component, we add the ```@typeparam``` directive; then, we can
use the type in the code of the component like this:

```c#
@typeparam TItem
@code
{
[Parameter]
public List<TItem> Data { get; set; }
}
```

Changing the layout

```c#
@layout AnotherLayout
```
This way, our component will use the specified layout (this only works for components with the
```
@page
``` 
directive).

Setting a namespace
By default, the component’s namespace will be the name of the default namespace of our project,
plus the folder structure.

```
@namespace Another.NameSpace
```
Setting a route
We have already touched on the @page directive. If we want our component to be directly accessed
using a URL, we can use the @page directive:

```
@page "/theurl"
```
Adding a using statement

To add a namespace to our component, we can use the @using directive:

```
@using System.IO
```

Understanding dependency injection
DI is a software pattern and a technique to implement Inversion of Control (IoC).
IoC is a generic term that means we can indicate that the class needs a class instance instead of
letting our classes instantiate an object. We can say that our class wants either a specific class
or a specific interface.

```c#
//Program.cs:
builder.Services.AddScoped<IBlogApi, BlogApiJsonDirectAccess>();
```
We can configure the creation of objects in different ways, such as the following:
• Singleton
• Scoped
• Transient

``` c#
services.AddSingleton<IWeatherForecastService, WeatherForecastService>();
services.AddScoped<IWeatherForecastService, WeatherForecastService>();

services.AddTransient<IWeatherForecastService, WeatherForecastService>();
```

## Injecting the service

``` c#
@inject WeatherForecastService ForecastService
[Inject]
public WeatherForecastService ForecastService { get; set; }
```

The third way is for when we want to inject a service into another service – then, we need to inject
the services using the constructor:

```c#
public class MyService
{
public MyService(WeatherForecastService
weatherForecastService)
{
}
}
```


## Query String  Parsing 
A component can also receive parameters from the query string. A query string is used to assign
values to the specified parameters. To indicate that the parameter can come from the query string,
we decorate the parameter with the SupplyParameterFromQuery attribute.

```C#
[Parameter]
[SupplyParameterFromQuery]
public int? Increment { get; set; }
```

• bool
• DateTime
• decimal
• double
• float
• Guid
• int
• long
• string

## Component life cycle
Razor components inherit from the ComponentBase class. The ComponentBase class includes both
asynchronous and synchronous methods that are used to manage the life cycle of a component.
In this book, we will be using the asynchronous versions of the methods since they execute
without blocking other operations.

• SetParametersAsync: This method sets the parameters that are supplied by the component’s
parent in the render tree.
• OnInitializedAsync: This method is invoked after the parameters have been set and the
component has been successfully initialized.
• OnParametersSetAsync: This method is invoked after the component initializes and each
time the component rerenders. A component will rerender when the parent component
rerenders and at least one parameter has changed. Also, a component will rerender when
the StateHasChanged method of the component is called.
• OnAfterRenderAsync: This method is invoked after the component has finished rendering.
This method is for working with JavaScript since JavaScript requires the Document
Object Model (DOM) elements to be rendered before they can do any work.


## Component structure
The following diagram shows code from the Counter component of the Demo project that we will
create in this chapter:

## Directives
Directives are used to add special functionality, such as routing, layout, and dependency injection.
File-level directives are defined within Razor, and you cannot define your own directives. Razor
directives start with the @ symbol.

@attribute: This directive adds a class-level attribute to the component. The following
example adds the [Authorize] attribute:
@attribute [Authorize]
• @code: This directive adds class members to the component. In the example, it is used to
distinguish the code block.
• @implements: This directive implements an interface for the specified class.
• @inherits: This directive provides full control of the class that the view inherits.
• @inject: This directive is used for dependency injection. It enables the component to inject
a service from the dependency injection container into the view. The following example
injects the HttpClient defined in the Program.cs file into the component:
@inject HttpClient Http
• @layout: This directive is used to specify a layout for the Razor components that include
an @page directive.
• @namespace: This directive sets the component’s namespace. You only need to use this
directive if you do not want to use the default namespace for the component. The default
namespace is based on the location of the component.
• @page: This directive is used for routing.
• @preservewhitespace: This directive is used to preserve the whitespace in the rendered
markup. If it is set to true, the whitespace is preserved. The default is false.
• @using: This directive controls the components that are in scope.

## Markup
Markup is HTML with Razor syntax. The Razor syntax can be used to render text and allows C#
to be included as part of the markup. We will cover more about Razor syntax later in this chapter.
## Code block
The code block contains the logic for the page. It begins with the @code directive. By convention,
the code block is at the bottom of the page. It is the only file-level directive that is not placed at
the top of the page.

## Routing

```html
 <!-- Navigation url -->
 <base href="/" />
```


This is the @page directive used by the Counter component:

``` C#
@page "/counter"
```
## Route parameters
Route parameters can be used to populate the parameters of a component. The parameters of
both the component and the route must have the same name, but they are not case-sensitive.

```c#
@page "/routing"
@page "/routing/{text}"
<h1>Blazor WebAssembly is @Text!</h1>
@code {
[Parameter] public string? Text { get; set; }
protected override void OnInitialized()
{
Text = Text ?? "fantastic";
}
}
```

## Optional route parameters
Optional route parameters are supported by Blazor.

```c#
@page "/routing/{text?}"
<h1>Blazor WebAssembly is @Text!</h1>
@code {
[Parameter] public string? Text { get; set; }
protected override void OnInitialized()
{
Text = Text ?? "fantastic";
}
}
```
