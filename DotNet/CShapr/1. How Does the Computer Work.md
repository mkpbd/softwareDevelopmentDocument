#### **CPU – Central Processing Unit**

CPU is the heart of the computer. CPU stands for Central Processing Unit or Microprocessor. The computer’s brain is the CPU, where actual data manipulation or Operations happen using ALU (Arithmetic and Logical Unit). 
Programs, which are sets of instructions stored in memory, are executed by the CPU step by step. The CPU consists of two components, i.e., ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) and CU (Control Unit).

- **ALU- Arithmetic Logic Unit:** The ALU performs arithmetic and logical operations on the provided data. Arithmetic operations include basic computations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, while logical operations include operations such as AND, OR, NOT, XOR (exclusive OR), comparisons like greater than, less than, equal to, etc. The ALU takes in the data from the input registers, processes it as per the instruction, and then outputs the result, which may either be stored back in a register or used in further computations.
- **CU- Control Unit:** On the other hand, the Control Unit is responsible for directing the processor’s operations. It acts as the brain within the CPU, fetching instructions from memory, decoding them to understand the required action, and then executing them by coordinating with the appropriate components of the system, including the ALU, memory, and input/output devices. The CU controls the flow of data within the CPU and between the CPU and other components of the computer system, ensuring that the instructions are executed in the correct sequence and at the right time.

The ALU and CU enable the CPU to perform a wide range of functions, from simple calculations and data processing to complex decision-making and control operations.

#### **Hard Disk:**

A hard disk is a storage device for a computer. It is the long-term memory where data is stored persistently, even when the computer is turned off. It’s slower than RAM but can hold much more data. It is a non-volatile storage device that retains the data even when the computer is turned off. Hard disks are used to store the operating system, software applications, and most other files.

It contains two types of files, i.e., data files and program files. Data files and program files are two fundamental types of files stored on a hard disk in a computer. Each serves distinct purposes and plays a crucial role in the functioning of a computer system. Here’s a closer look at both:

##### **Data Files**

Data files are created by users or generated by software applications to store information. This information can vary widely, from documents created in word processors to databases managed by database management software, images, videos, spreadsheets, etc. The key characteristic of data files is that they do not contain code that is executed directly by the computer’s CPU. Instead, they are read by software applications that perform operations based on the data contained within these files. Examples of data files include:

- Text documents (.txt, .docx, .pdf)
- Spreadsheets (.xls, .xlsx)
- Presentations (.ppt, .pptx)
- Databases (.db, .sql)
- Images (.jpg, .png, .gif)
- Audio files (.mp3, .wav)
- Video files (.mp4, .avi)

##### **Program Files**

On the other hand, Program Files contain executable code that tells a computer what operations to perform. When you run a program, the computer’s CPU reads and executes the code contained within these files. Program files can include applications, system services, libraries, and other components necessary to operate complex software systems. Examples of program files include:

- Executable files (.exe on Windows, no extension or .app on macOS, .bin or no extension on Linux)
- Dynamic link libraries (.dll on Windows)
- Shared libraries (.so on Linux, .dylib on macOS)
- Scripts (.sh for shell scripts, .py for Python scripts)
- System files necessary for operating system operation, which could be in various formats depending on the OS

![[how-does-computer-memory-work.webp]]

- **Program files:** The music player on the computer, notepad on the computer, and MS Office on the computer are program files. That means any application or software installed on the computer is a program file.
- **Data files:** Movies, Songs, Word Documents, Text Documents, etc. are data files. The data files contain the actual data. We need a program file if you want to perform read and write operations on the data (i.e., the data file).

**Note:** Without a program file, we cannot perform the read and write operations on the data file. For example, you have a .doc file, but if you have uninstalled MS Office from your machine, then even though you have the doc file, you cannot perform any operation on that doc file.

##### **Main Memory:**

Main memory, also known as RAM (Random Access Memory), is the computer’s primary storage area that the CPU uses to store data and programs while they are being used. This is the computer’s short-term memory, where data is stored temporarily while programs are running. RAM is volatile, so it loses its contents when the power is turned off. It provides fast access to the CPU, allowing the computer to perform tasks efficiently. The more RAM a computer has, the more data and applications it can handle simultaneously, improving overall performance.


##### **Input Devices:**

These devices allow users to interact with the computer, entering data and commands through devices like keyboards, mice, scanners, cameras, and microphones. These devices are used to give inputs to the computer. Input devices have their own memory in the computer called Input Buffer. All instructions from input devices are dumped into this memory, and if the program wants to read something, it will read from the input buffer. So, whatever we type using the keyboard will be stored in the input buffer, and the program reads the input from the input buffer.


##### **Output Devices:**

Output devices are peripherals that receive data from a computer and translate it into a form understandable to the user or another device. They allow the computer to communicate with the user or other systems. Common output devices include monitors (for displaying visual information), printers (for printing documents), speakers (for sound), and projectors. Output devices also have their own memory, which is called output buffers. If the program wants to print something, then whatever it wants to print will be put in the output buffer, which will appear on the output screen.

##### **How It All Works Together?**

When a user runs an application:

- The operating system loads the application from storage into RAM.
- The CPU fetches and executes the application’s instructions, using input data as needed.
- The application processes the data, producing output.
- The output is sent to an output device (e.g., display on the monitor) or stored in long-term storage.

This is a very high-level overview, and each component and step involves intricate processes and technologies. The actual working of a computer includes numerous additional details, such as the motherboard, power supply, cooling systems, and the binary system that underpins all computer operations.

##### **What is Computer Language?**

A computer language is also a set of instructions; in other words, we can say a set of programs that the computer can understand. So, in simple words, we can say that computer language is a formal language used to communicate with a computer.

##### **Why do we need Computer language?**

If one person wants to communicate with another, generally, communication means they have to share information, which is nothing but passing instructions. To do so, we use general languages like English, Hindi, Bangali

Communicating with the machine is a simple task. If I am asking the question, what are the factorials of five? Everyone can easily answer it as 120. All right, it is a simple calculation. If so, my next question is, what is the factorial of 7? No one can answer because it’s a bit complex operation. This complex operation can be performed very easily by a computer using programs. But the computer only understands the binary language, i.e., 0 and 1. That’s why there is a need for a programming language to communicate with computers.
![[what-is-the-need-for-computer-language.webp]]

Suppose the person wants to communicate with the computer. In that case, the person needs to pass instructions in the machine code or binary code only, i.e., a computer can understand only machine code or binary code. So that’s why first we have to learn one programming language properly. Many programming languages like C, C++, Java, and C# exist. All these are high-level programming languages.

	![[word-image-89.webp]]
So, to communicate with Computers, we write programs using any programming language. If you want to communicate with the computer using the C language, first you should learn the C language perfectly. After learning the language, you can write programs. A program means a set of instructions. For example, a equals 10, b equals 20, and c equals a plus b. We are taking two variables, nothing but two values, and adding and printing the result.


![[word-image-90.webp]]

Programs get converted by the Compiler and generate machine code. The compiler converts all these instructions into binary language or machine code.

![[word-image-91.webp]]

Now, the machine code is ready. So, once the machine code is ready, you can pass it as input to the computer. The computer will produce the output.

![[word-image-92.webp]]


##### **What is an Interface?**

It is not always necessary to be a programmer to communicate with machines. An end-user can also communicate with the machine, which is possible using an interface. The interface means without having the background details, we can perform our tasks.

Consider an end user; the end-user wants to perform one ATM transaction, and the end user can communicate using interfaces. For example, if the end-user understands the English language, then the end-user clicks on English. All the instructions will come in English, and operations will be performed.

![[what-is-an-interface.webp]]

What is happening in the background is not required for the end user. For example, if you are driving a car and you want to increase the speed of the car, you will accelerate generally. So, the speed will increase whenever we accelerate, but we don’t know what is happening in the background, we don’t know.

![[what-is-the-job-of-a-programmer.webp]]

##### **Types of Computer Languages:**

A Programming Language or Computer Language is a language that comprises a set of instructions that is used to communicate with the computer. Programming Language is classified into two types:

1. **High-Level Programming Language**
2. **Low-level Programming Language**
![[Types-of-Computer-Languages.webp]]

##### **What is a Low-level Programming Language?**

Low-Level Programming Languages are languages that the system can easily understand. These are system-dependent languages. In these two languages are there i.e.

1. **Machine Language**
2. **Assembly Language**

##### **What is Machine-level language**

Machine Language is the system’s fundamental language and can be directly understandable without any translation. These are machine-oriented languages that use the collection of the binary of 1’s and 0’s.

The machine-level language is a language that consists of a set of instructions that are in the binary form 0’s or 1’s. As we know, computers can only understand machine instructions, which are in binary digits, i.e., 0 and 1, so the instructions given to the computer can be only in binary codes.

Creating a program in a machine-level language is very difficult as it is not easy for programmers to write the program in machine instructions. It is error-prone as it is not easy to understand, and its maintenance is also very high.

A machine-level language is not portable as each computer has its machine instructions, so writing a program on one computer will no longer be valid on another computer. That means the machine instruction of Windows OS is not going to be the same for Linux OS and even not going to be the same for Mac OS.

##### **Assembly Language**

The Assembly Language can be called Symbolic Language. Different types of symbols will be used in this language to design the program. However, this assembly code is not directly understandable to the system, so we require translators.

The assembly language contains human-readable commands such as mov, add, mul, div, sub, etc. The problems we were facing in machine-level language are reduced to some extent by using an extended form of machine-level language known as assembly language. Since assembly language instructions are written in English, words like mov, add, mul, sub, etc. So, it is a little easier to write and understand than machine language.

As we know, computers can only understand machine-level instructions, so we require a translator that converts the assembly code into machine code. The translator used for translating the code is known as an assembler. The assembly language code is not portable because the data is stored in computer registers, and the computer has to know the different sets of registers.

The assembly code is not faster than machine code because the assembly language comes above the machine language in the hierarchy, meaning that assembly language has some abstraction from the hardware while machine language has zero abstraction.

##### **What is a high-level programming language?**

The High-Level Programming Languages are syntactically similar to English and easy to understand. High-Level Programming Languages are user-dependent languages. A High-Level Programming Language combines alphabets, digits, and symbols. By using a high-level programming language, we are developing user interface applications. Examples: C, C++, VC++, JAVA, C#, Swift, Objective C, D-Language.


##### **What is Software?**

Software is a collection of programs that uses the resources of the Hardware components. A Program is a set of instructions designed for a particular task. The set of programs is called software.

Let us understand this with an example, i.e., Calculator. For each button, there is some program written inside it. That means a calculator is a collection of programs. And we can also say that a Calculator is a software. That means the software is a collection of programs.

![[programming-languages.webp]]

##### **Types of Software:**

Software is classified into two types, i.e., System Software and Application Software. For a better understanding, please have a look at the below image.
![[types-of-software.webp]]


##### **What is a Translator?**

Always the user’s given instructions are in English, which is called source code. But the computer is not able to understand this source code and the computer’s understandable code is binary / machine. To convert this source code into binary code we are using the interface software called translators.

Translators are system software that converts programming language code into binary format. The translators are classified into three types:

1. **Compiler**
2. **Interpreter**
3. **Assembler**
![[what-is-a-translator.webp]]

##### **Compilers:**

The compiler translates High-level code (Source code) to Machine code All at once. Let us take an example: Say you have written a program in a high-level language that does simple arithmetic operations like addition, multiplication, etc. When you give this program to the compiler, the compiler translates all the instructions written in the program into machine code. Then after it gives a full-translated machine code to computers.

![[compiler.webp]]
A compiler is the system software that translates High-level programming language code into binary format in a single step except for those lines which are having errors. It checks all kinds of limits, ranges, errors, etc. But its execution time is more and occupies the largest part of the memory.
![[word-image-93.webp]]

##### **Interpreter:**

The interpreter translates each High-level instruction to machine code One by one. We can take the above example, which we used, for compilers. When we give the program to the interpreter, it translates the first instruction and generates the machine code, and gives it to the computer. Thereafter second instruction translation goes on until all the instructions were converted to machine code.

![[interpreter.webp]]

##### **Assembler:**

It is the system software that converts assembly language instructions into binary formats.
