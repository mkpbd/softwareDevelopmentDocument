##### **What are Operators in C#?**

Operators in C# are symbols that are used to perform operations on operands. For example, consider the expression **2 + 3 = 5**, here **2 and 3 are operands**, and **+ and = are called operators**. So, the Operators in C# are used to manipulate the variables and values in a program.

**int x = 10, y = 20;**  
**int result1 = x + y;** //Operator Manipulating Variables, where x and y are variables and + is operator  
**int result2 = 10 + 20;** //Operator Manipulating Values, where 10 and 20 are value and + is operator


##### **Types of Operators in C#:**

The Operators are classified based on the type of operations they perform on operands in C# language. They are as follows:

1. **Arithmetic Operators**
2. **Relational Operators**
3. **Logical Operators**
4. **Bitwise Operators**
5. **Assignment Operators**
6. **Unary Operators or**
7. **Ternary Operator or Conditional Operator**

In C#, the Operators can also be categorized based on the Number of Operands:

1. **Unary Operator**: The Operator that requires one operand (variable or value) to perform the operation is called Unary Operator.
2. **Binary Operator**: Then Operator that requires two operands (variables or values) to perform the operation is called Binary Operator.
3. **Ternary Operator**: The Operator that requires three operands (variables or values) to perform the operation is called Ternary Operator. The Ternary Operator is also called Conditional Operator.

##### **Arithmetic Operators in C#**

**Addition Operator (+):**  
The + operator adds two operands. As this operator works with two operands, so, this + (plus) operator belongs to the category of the binary operator. The + Operator adds the left-hand side operand value with the right-hand side operand value and returns the result. For example:  
**int a=10;**  
**int b=5;**  
**int c = a+b; //15, Here, it will add the a and b operand values i.e. 10 + 5**

**Subtraction Operator (-):**  
The – operator subtracts two operands. As this operator works with two operands, so, this – (minus) operator belongs to the category of the binary operator. The Minus Operator substracts the left-hand side operand value from the right-hand side operand value and returns the result. For example:  
**int a=10;**  
**int b=5;**  
**int c = a-b; //5, Here, it will subtract b from a i.e. 10 – 5**

**Multiplication Operator (*):**  
The * (Multiply) operator multiplies two operands. As this operator works with two operands, so, this * (Multiply) operator belongs to the category of the binary operator. The Multiply Operator multiplies the left-hand side operand value with the right-hand side operand value and returns the result. For example:  
**int a=10;**  
**int b=5;**  
**int c=a*b; //50, Here, it will multiply a with b i.e. 10 * 5**


**Division Operator (/):**  
The / (Division) operator divides two operands. As this operator works with two operands, so, this / (Division) operator belongs to the category of the binary operator. The Division Operator divides the left-hand side operand value with the right-hand side operand value and returns the result. For example:   
**int a=10;**  
**int b=5;**  
**int c=a/b; //2, Here, it will divide 10 / 5**

**Modulus Operator (%):**  
The % (Modulos) operator returns the remainder when the first operand is divided by the second. As this operator works with two operands, so, this % (Modulos) operator belongs to the category of the binary operator. For example:  
**int a=10;**  
**int b=5;**  
**int c=a%b; //0, Here, it will divide 10 / 5 and it will return the remainder which is 0 in this case**

    }
}

```

###### **Simple Assignment (=):**

This operator is used to assign the value of the right-hand side operand to the left-hand side operand i.e. to a variable.   
**For example:**  
**int a=10;**  
**int b=20;**  
**char ch = ‘a’;**  
**a=a+4; //(a=10+4)**  
**b=b-4; //(b=20-4)**

###### **Add Assignment (+=):**

This operator is the combination of + and = operators. It is used to add the left-hand side operand value with the right-hand side operand value and then assign the result to the left-hand side variable.  
**For example:**  
**int a=5;**  
**int b=6;**  
**a += b; //a=a+b; That means (a += b) can be written as (a = a + b)**

###### **Subtract Assignment (-=):**

This operator is the combination of – and = operators. It is used to subtract the right-hand side operand value from the left-hand side operand value and then assign the result to the left-hand side variable.   
**For example:**  
**int a=10;**  
**int b=5;**  
**a -= b; //a=a-b; That means (a -= b) can be written as (a = a – b)**

###### **Multiply Assignment (*=):**

This operator is the combination of * and = operators. It is used to multiply the left-hand side operand value with the right-hand side operand value and then assign the result to the left-hand side variable.   
**For example:**  
**int a=10;**  
**int b=5;**  
**a *= b; //a=a*b; That means (a *= b) can be written as (a = a * b)**

###### **Division Assignment (/=):**

This operator is the combination of / and = operators. It is used to divide the left-hand side operand value with the right-hand side operand value and then assign the result to the left-hand side variable.   
**For example:**  
**int a=10;**  
**int b=5;**  
**a /= b; //a=a/b; That means (a /= b) can be written as (a = a / b)**

###### **Modulus Assignment (%=):**

This operator is the combination of % and = operators. It is used to divide the left-hand side operand value with the right-hand side operand value and then assigns the remainder of this division to the left-hand side variable.   
**For example:**  
**int a=10;**  
**int b=5;**  
**a %= b; //a=a%b; That means (a %= b) can be written as (a = a % b)**

##### **Example to Understand Assignment Operators in C#:**

```C#
using System;
namespace OperatorsDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            // Initialize variable x using Simple Assignment Operator "="
            int x = 15;

            x += 10;  //It means x = x + 10 i.e. 15 + 10 = 25
            Console.WriteLine($"Add Assignment Operator: {x}");

            // initialize variable x again
            x = 20;
            x -= 5;  //It means x = x - 5 i.e. 20 - 5 = 15
            Console.WriteLine($"Subtract Assignment Operator: {x}");

            // initialize variable x again
            x = 15;
            x *= 5; //It means x = x * 5  i.e. 15 * 5 = 75
            Console.WriteLine($"Multiply Assignment Operator: {x}");

            // initialize variable x again
            x = 25;
            x /= 5; //It means x = x / 5 i.e. 25 / 5 = 5
            Console.WriteLine($"Division Assignment Operator: {x}");

            // initialize variable x again
            x = 25;
            x %= 5; //It means x = x % 5 i.e. 25 % 5 = 0
            Console.WriteLine($"Modulo Assignment Operator: {x}");

            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}

```


##### **Relational Operators in C#:**

The Relational Operators in C# are also known as Comparison Operators. It determines the relationship between two operands and returns the Boolean results, i.e. true or false after the comparison. The Different Types of Relational Operators supported by C# are as follows.

###### **Equal to (==):**

This Operator is used to return true if the left-hand side operand value is equal to the right-hand side operand value. For example, `5==3 is evaluated to be false. So`, `this Equal to (==) operator will check whether the two given operand values are equal or not. If equal returns true else returns false.`

###### **Not Equal to (!=):**

This Operator is used to return true if the left-hand side operand value is not equal to the right-hand side operand value. For example, 5!=3 is evaluated to be true. So, this Not Equal to (!=) operator will check whether the two given operand values are equal or not. If equal returns false else returns true.

###### **Less than (<):**

This Operator is used to return true if the left-hand side operand value is less than the right-hand side operand value. For example, 5<3 is evaluated to be false. So, this Less than (<) operator will check whether the first operand value is less than the second operand value or not. If so, returns true else returns false.

###### **Less than or equal to (<=):**

This Operator is used to return true if the left-hand side operand value is less than or equal to the right-hand side operand value. For example, 5<=5 is evaluated to be true. So. this Less than or equal to (<=) operator will check whether the first operand value is less than or equal to the second operand value. If so returns true else returns false.

###### **Greater than (>):**

This Operator is used to return true if the left-hand side operand value is greater than the right-hand side operand value. For example, 5>3 is evaluated to be true. So, this Greater than (>) operator will check whether the first operand value is greater than the second operand value. If so, returns true else return false.

###### **Greater than or Equal to (>=):**

This Operator is used to return true if the left-hand side operand value is greater than or equal to the right-hand side operand value. For example, 5>=5 is evaluated to be true. So, this Greater than or Equal to (>=) operator will check whether the first operand value is greater than or equal to the second operand value. If so, returns true else returns false.

##### **Example to Understand Relational Operators in C#:**

```C#
using System;
namespace OperatorsDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            bool Result;
            int Num1 = 5, Num2 = 10;

            // Equal to Operator
            Result = (Num1 == Num2);
            Console.WriteLine("Equal (=) to Operator: " + Result);

            // Greater than Operator
            Result = (Num1 > Num2);
            Console.WriteLine("Greater (<) than Operator: " + Result);

            // Less than Operator
            Result = (Num1 < Num2);
            Console.WriteLine("Less than (>) Operator: " + Result);

            // Greater than Equal to Operator
            Result = (Num1 >= Num2);
            Console.WriteLine("Greater than or Equal to (>=) Operator: " + Result);

            // Less than Equal to Operator
            Result = (Num1 <= Num2);
            Console.WriteLine("Lesser than or Equal to (<=) Operator: " + Result);

            // Not Equal To Operator
            Result = (Num1 != Num2);
            Console.WriteLine("Not Equal to (!=) Operator: " + Result);

            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}

```

##### **Logical Operators in C#:**

The Logical Operators are mainly used in conditional statements and loops for evaluating a condition. These operators are going to work with boolean expressions. The different types of Logical Operators supported in C# are as follows:

##### **Logical OR (||):**

This operator is used to return true if either of the Boolean expressions is true. For example, false || true is evaluated to be true. That means the Logical OR (||) operator returns true when one (or both) of the conditions in the expression is satisfied. Otherwise, it will return false. For example, a || b returns true if either a or b is true. Also, it returns true when both a and b are true.

##### **Logical AND (&&):**

This operator is used to return true if all the Boolean Expressions are true. For example, false && true is evaluated to be false. That means the Logical AND (&&) operator returns true when both the conditions in the expression are satisfied. Otherwise, it will return false. For example, a && b return true only when both a and b are true.

##### **Logical NOT (!):**

This operator is used to return true if the condition in the expression is not satisfied. Otherwise, it will return false. For example, !a returns true if a is false.

##### **Example to Understand Logical Operators in C#:**

```C#
using System;
namespace OperatorsDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            bool x = true, y = false, z;

            //Logical AND operator
            z = x && y;
            Console.WriteLine("Logical AND Operator (&&) : " + z);

            //Logical OR operator
            z = x || y;
            Console.WriteLine("Logical OR Operator (||) : " + z);

            //Logical NOT operator
            z = !x;
            Console.WriteLine("Logical NOT Operator (!) : " + z);

            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}

```

##### **Unary Operators in C#:**
The Unary Operators in C# need only one operand. They are used to increment or decrement a value. There are two types of Unary Operators. They are as follows:

1. **Increment operators (++): Example: (++x, x++)**
2. **Decrement operators (–): Example: (–x, x–)**

##### **Increment Operator (++) in C# Language:**

The Increment Operator (++) is a unary operator. It operates on a single operand only. Again, it is classified into two types:

1. **Post-Increment Operator**
2. **Pre-Increment Operator**

##### **Post Increment Operators:**

The Post Increment Operators are the operators that are used as a suffix to its variable. It is placed after the variable. For example, a++ will also increase the value of the variable a by 1.

**Syntax:** **Variable++;**  
**Example:** **x++;**

##### **Pre-Increment Operators:**

The Pre-Increment Operators are the operators which are used as a prefix to its variable. It is placed before the variable. For example, ++a will increase the value of the variable a by 1.

**Syntax:** **++Variable;**  
**Example:** **++x;**

##### **Decrement Operators in C# Language:**

The Decrement Operator (–) is a unary operator. It takes one value at a time. It is again classified into two types. They are as follows:

1. **Post Decrement Operator**
2. **Pre-Decrement Operator**

##### **Post Decrement Operators:**

The Post Decrement Operators are the operators that are used as a suffix to its variable. It is placed after the variable. For example, a– will also decrease the value of the variable a by 1.

**Syntax:** **Variable–;**  
**Example:** **x–;**

##### **Pre-Decrement Operators:**

The Pre-Decrement Operators are the operators that are a prefix to its variable. It is placed before the variable. For example, –a will decrease the value of the variable a by 1.

**Syntax:** **–Variable;**  
**Example: — x;**
![[Unary-Operators-in-C.webp]]
**Note:** Increment Operator means to increment the value of the variable by 1 and Decrement Operator means to decrement the value of the variable by 1.

```c#
using System;
namespace OperatorsDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            // Post-Increment
            int x = 10;
            // Result1 is assigned 10 only,
            // x is not updated yet
            int Result1 = x++;
            //x becomes 11 now
            Console.WriteLine("x is {0} and Result1 is {1}", x, Result1);

            // Pre-Increment 
            int y = 10;
            int Result2 = ++y;
            //y and Result2 have same values = 11
            Console.WriteLine("y is {0} and Result2 is {1}", y, Result2);

            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}

```

##### **Example to understand Decrement Operators in C# Language:**

```C#
using System;
namespace OperatorsDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            // Post-Decrement
            int x = 10;
            // Result1 is assigned 10 only,
            // x is not yet updated
            int Result1 = x--;
            //x becomes 9 now
            Console.WriteLine("x is {0} and Result1 is {1}", x, Result1);

            // Pre-Decrement 
            int y = 10;
            int Result2 = --y;
            //y and Result2 have same values i.e. 9
            Console.WriteLine("y is {0} and Result2 is {1}", y, Result2);

            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}

```

##### **Five Steps to Understand How the Unary Operators Works in C#?**
To make you understand how exactly the unary ++ and — operators work in C#, we need to follow 5 simple steps. The steps are shown in the below diagram.
![[five-steps-to-understand-the-unary-operators-in-c.webp]]

1. **Step 1:** If there is some pre-increment or pre-decrement in the expression, that should execute first.
2. **Step 2:** The second step is to substitute the values in the expression.
3. **Step 3:** In the third step we need to evaluate the expression.
4. **Step 4: I**n the fourth step Assignment needs to be performed.
5. **Step 5:** The final step is to perform post-increment or post-decrement.
##### **Example to Understand Increment and Decrement Operators in C# Language:**

```C#
using System;
namespace OperatorsDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            int x = 10, y = 20, z;
            z = x++ * --y;
            Console.WriteLine($"x={x}, y={y}, z={z}");
            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}

```

1. The First step is **Pre-Increment or Pre-Decrement**. Is there any pre-increment or pre-decrement in the expression? There is no pre-increment but there is a pre-decrement in the expression i.e. –y. So, execute that pre-decrement operator which will decrease the value of y by 1 i.e. now y becomes 19.
2. The second step is **Substitution**. So, substitute the values of x and y. That means x will be substituted by 10 and y will be substituted by 19.
3. The third step is **Evaluation**. So, evaluate the expression i.e. 10 * 19 = 190.
4. The fourth step is the **Assignment**. So, assign the evaluated value to the given variable i.e. 190 will be assigned to z. So, now the z value becomes 190.
5. The last step is **Post-Increment and Post-Decrement**. Is there any post-increment or post-decrement in the expression? There is no post-decrement but there is a post-increment in the expression i.e. x++. So, execute that post-increment which will increase the value of x by 1 i.e. x becomes 11.

```C#
using System;
namespace OperatorsDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
            {
                Console.WriteLine(i);
            }
            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}
```

##### **Ternary Operator in C#:**

The Ternary Operator in C# is also known as the Conditional Operator (**?:**). It is actually the shorthand of the if-else statement. It is called ternary because it has three operands or arguments. The first argument is a comparison argument, the second is the result of a true comparison, and the third is the result of a false comparison.

**Syntax: ==Condition? first_expression : second_expression;**==

The above statement means that first, we need to evaluate the condition. If the condition is true the first_expression is executed and becomes the result and if the condition is false, the second_expression is executed and becomes the result.

##### **Example to understand Ternary Operator in C#:**


```C#
using System;
namespace OperatorsDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            int a = 20, b = 10, res;
            res = ((a > b) ?a : b);
            Console.WriteLine("Result = " + res);
			// Output: Result = 20
            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}

```


##### **Control Flow Statements in C#:**

The Control Flow Statements in C# are the statements that Alter the Flow of Program Execution and provide better control to the programmer on the flow of execution. The Control Flow Statements are useful to write better and more complex programs. A program executes from top to bottom except when we use control statements. We can control the order of execution of the program, based on logic and values.

##### **Example to Understand Control Flow Statements in C#:**

By default, when we write statements in a program, the statements are going to be executed sequentially from top to bottom line by line. For example, in the below program we have written five statements. Now, if you execute the below program, the statements are going to be executed one by one from the top to bottom. That means, first it will execute statement1, then statement2, then statement3, then statement4, and finally statement5.

```C#
using System;
namespace ControlFlowDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Executing Statment1");
            Console.WriteLine("Executing Statment2");
            Console.WriteLine("Executing Statment3");
            Console.WriteLine("Executing Statment4");
            Console.WriteLine("Executing Statment5");
            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}

```


It is also possible in the C# programming language to alter the execution of the program. What it means, instead of executing the statements sequentially one by one, we can change the order of execution. If we want, we can skip some of the statement execution based on some conditions. If we want, we can also jump from one statement to another statement inside the program, let’s say jumping from statement 1 to statement 4. Even if we want, we can repeatedly execute some of the statements multiple times. And this is possible because of Control Flow Statements in C#.

```C#
using System;
namespace ControlFlowDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            if(10 > 5)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Executing Statment1");
                Console.WriteLine("Executing Statment2");
            }
            else
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Executing Statment3");
                Console.WriteLine("Executing Statment4");
            }
            
            Console.WriteLine("Executing Statment5");
            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}

```

In the below example, we are repeatedly executing the statement which is there inside the for-loop block 5 times. After executing the for-loop body 5 times, it will then come out from the loop and execute the other statement only once. This is possible because of the looping conditional statement.

```C#
using System;
namespace ControlFlowDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Welcome to C#.NET");
            }
            
            Console.WriteLine("Some Other Statement");
            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}

```

In the below example, after executing the statement1, the control will jump to statement4 by skipping statement2 and statement3. Here, we are using the goto control statement.

```C#
using System;
namespace ControlFlowDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Executing Statment1");
            goto statement4;   //goto label someLabel:
            Console.WriteLine("Executing Statment2");
            Console.WriteLine("Executing Statment3");

            statement4:    //label:
            Console.WriteLine("Executing Statment4");
            Console.WriteLine("Executing Statment5");
            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}

```

### **Types of Control Flow Statements in C#:**

In C#, the control flow statements are divided into the following three categories:

1. **[Selection Statements or Branching Statements](https://dotnettutorials.net/lesson/if-else-statements-in-csharp/):** (Examples: if-else, switch case, nested if-else, if-else ladder)
2. **[Iteration Statements or Looping Statements](https://dotnettutorials.net/lesson/loops-in-csharp/):** (Examples: while loop, do-while loop, for-loop, and foreach loop)
3. [**Jumping Statements**](https://dotnettutorials.net/lesson/break-statement-in-csharp/): (Examples: break, continue, return, goto)

For a better understanding, please have a look at the following diagram which shows the classification of different control flow statements.

**Note:** The Control Flow Statements are used to write powerful programs by repeating important sections of the program and selecting between optional sections of a program.





##### **Bitwise Operators in C#:**

The Bitwise Operators in C# perform bit-by-bit processing. They can be used with any of the **integer (short, int, long, ushort, uint, ulong, byte)** types. The different types of Bitwise Operators supported in C# are as follows.

###### **Bitwise OR (|)**

Bitwise OR operator is represented by |. This operator performs the bitwise OR operation on the corresponding bits of the two operands involved in the operation. If either of the bits is 1, it gives 1. If not, it gives 0.  
For example,  
**int a=12, b=25;**  
**int result = a|b; //29**  
**How?**  
12 Binary Number: **00001100**  
25 Binary Number: **00011001**  
Bitwise OR operation between 12 and 25:  
**00001100**  
**00011001**  
**========**  
**00011101 (it is 29 in decimal)**  
**Note**: If the operands are of type bool, the bitwise OR operation is equivalent to the logical OR operation between them.

###### **Bitwise AND (&):**

Bitwise OR operator is represented by &. This operator performs the bitwise AND operation on the corresponding bits of two operands involved in the operation. If both of the bits are 1, it gives 1. If either of the bits is not 1, it gives 0.  
For example,  
**int a=12, b=25;**  
**int result = a&b; //8**  
How?  
12 Binary Number: 00001100  
25 Binary Number: 00011001  
Bitwise AND operation between 12 and 25:  
**00001100**  
**00011001**  
**========**  
**00001000 (it is 8 in decimal)**  
**Note**: If the operands are of type bool, the bitwise AND operation is equivalent to the logical AND operation between them.

###### **Bitwise XOR (^):**

The bitwise OR operator is represented by ^. This operator performs a bitwise XOR operation on the corresponding bits of two operands. If the corresponding bits are different, it gives 1. If the corresponding bits are the same, it gives 0.  
For example,  
**int a=12, b=25;**  
**int result = a^b; //21**  
How?  
12 Binary Number: 00001100  
25 Binary Number: 00011001  
Bitwise AND operation between 12 and 25:  
**00001100**  
**00011001**  
**========**  
**00010101 (it is 21 in decimal)**

##### **Example to Understand Bitwise Operators in C#:**

```C#
using System;
namespace OperatorsDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            int a = 12, b = 25, Result;

            // Bitwise AND Operator
            Result = a & b;
            Console.WriteLine($"Bitwise AND: {Result}");

            // Bitwise OR Operator
            Result = a | b;
            Console.WriteLine($"Bitwise OR: {Result}");

            // Bitwise XOR Operator
            Result = a ^ b;
            Console.WriteLine($"Bitwise XOR: {Result}");

            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}

```
