# If-Else Statements in C#
It executes a block of statements (one or more instructions) when the condition in the if block is true and when the condition is false, it will skip the execution of the if block. Using else block is optional in C#. Following is the syntax to use the if block in the C# language.

##### **Flow Chart of If Block:**

Let us understand how we will represent the execution flow of the if block using a flow chart. The starting point is represented by the oval symbol. And the flow will be from the condition and the condition is represented by a diamond shape. Here, first, we need to check the condition. And for every condition, two options are there i.e. if conditions are successful (condition is true) and if conditions are failed (condition is false). That means two situations are there i.e. TRUE and FALSE.

![[flow-chart-of-if-block.webp]]

**Note:** Here, the block of statements executes only when the condition is true. And if the condition is false, then it will skip the execution of the statements.

```C#
using System;
namespace ControlFlowDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            int number;
            Console.WriteLine("Enter a Number: ");
            number = Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine());
            if (number > 10)
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"{number} is greater than 10 ");
                Console.WriteLine("End of if block");
            }
            Console.WriteLine("End of Main Method");
            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}

```

##### **If Statement without Curly Braces in C# Language**

In the declaration of if block if we do not specify statements using blocks {} (curly braces), then only the first statement will be considered as the if block statement. To understand this, please have a look at the below example.

```C#
using System;
namespace ControlFlowDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            int number;
            Console.WriteLine("Enter a Number: ");
            number = Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine());
            if (number > 10)
                Console.WriteLine($"{number} is greater than 10 ");
            Console.WriteLine("End of Main Method");
            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}

```

##### **If Else Statements in C# Language:**
The If-Else block in C# Language is used to provide some optional information whenever the given condition is FALSE in the if block. That means if the condition is true, then the if block statements will be executed, and if the condition is false, then the else block statement will execute.

![[if-else-block-in-programming-language.webp]]

**Note:** The point that you need to remember is that only one block of statement i.e. either if block or else block is going to be executed at a time. So, if the condition is TRUE if block statements get executed and if the condition is FALSE, then else block statements get executed.


##### **Flow Chart of If-Else Block:**


![[flow-chart-of-if-else-block.webp]]


**Note:** In C# Programming Language, **if** and **else** are reserved words. That means you cannot use these two keywords for the naming of any variables, properties, class, methods, etc. The expressions or conditions specified in the if block can be a Relational or Boolean expression or condition that evaluates to TRUE or FALSE. Now let us see some examples to understand the if-else conditional statements.
##### **Example to Understand IF-ELSE Statement in C#:**


```C#
using System;
namespace ControlFlowDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Enter a Number: ");
            int number = Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine());
            if (number % 2 == 0)
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"{number} is an Even Number");
            }
            else
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"{number} is an Odd Number");
            }

            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}
```
##### **If and Else Block without Curly Braces in C# Programming Language**

```C#
using System;
namespace ControlFlowDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            int number = 10;
            if (number == 10)
                Console.WriteLine("Hi"); //This Statement belongs to IF Block
            else
                Console.WriteLine("Hello"); //This Statement belongs to ELSE Block
            Console.WriteLine("Bye");

            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}
```

##### **What is the Nested If block?**

![[nested-if-else-statement-syntax-in-c-language.webp]]

![[nested-if-else-statement-in-c-language-with-exampl.webp]]
1. **Condition1:** First, it will check the first if condition i.e. the outer if condition and if it is true, then the outer else block will be terminated. So, the control moves inside the first or the outer if block. Then again it checks the inner if condition and if the inner if condition is true, then the inner else block gets terminated. So, in this case, the outer if and inner if block statements get executed.
2. **Condition2:** Now, if the outer if condition is true, but the inner if condition is false, then the inner if block gets terminated. So, in this case, the outer if and inner else block statements get executed.
3. **Condition3:** Now, if the outer if condition is false, then the outer if block gets terminated and control moves to the outer else block. And inside the outer else block, again it checks the inner if condition, and if the inner if condition is true, then the inner else block gets terminated. So, in this case, the outer else and inner if block statements get executed.
4. **Condition4:** Now, if the outer if condition is false as well as the if condition inside the outer else blocks also failed, then the if block gets terminated. And in this case, the outer else and inner else block statements get executed. This is how statements get executed in Nested if. Now we will see the flow chart of nested if blocks.

# Switch Statements in C#

##### **Switch Statements in C# Language:**

The switch is a keyword in the C# language, and by using this switch keyword we can create selection statements with multiple blocks. And the Multiple blocks can be constructed by using the case keyword.

Switch case statements in C# are a substitute for long if else statements that compare a variable or expression to several values. The switch statement is a multi-way branching statement which means it provides an easy way to switch the execution to different parts of code based on the value of the expression. 

##### **When do we need to go for a switch statement?**

When there are several options and we have to choose only one option from the available options depending on a single condition then we need to go for a switch statement. Depending on the selected option a particular task can be performed.

##### **Syntax of Switch Statements in C# Language:**

In C#, the Switch statement is a multiway branch statement. It provides an efficient way to transfer the execution to different parts of a code based on the value of the expression. The switch expression is of integer type such as int, byte, or short, or of an enumeration type, or of character type, or of string type. The expression is checked for different cases and the match case will be executed. The following is the syntax to use switch case statement in C# language.


![[syntax-of-switch-statements-in-c-language.webp]]
In C#, duplicate case values are not allowed. So, you can create two case statements with the same value. If you try you will get a compilation error.

The default block in the switch statement is optional. That means you can create the switch statements with the default block and, it would run without any problem.

```C#
using System;
namespace ControlFlowDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            int x = 2;
            switch (x)
            {
                case 1:
                    Console.WriteLine("Choice is 1");
                    break;
                case 2:
                    Console.WriteLine("Choice is 2");
                    break;
                case 3:
                    Console.WriteLine("Choice is 3");
                    break;
                default:
                    Console.WriteLine("Choice other than 1, 2 and 3");
                    break;
            }
            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}

```

```C#
using System;
namespace ControlFlowDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            string str = "C#";
            switch (str)
            {
                case "C#":      
                case "Java":
                case "C":
                    Console.WriteLine("It’s a Programming Langauge");
                    break;

                case "MSSQL":
                case "MySQL":
                case "Oracle":
                    Console.WriteLine("It’s a Database");
                    break;

                case "MVC":
                case "WEB API":
                    Console.WriteLine("It’s a Framework");
                    break;

                default:
                    Console.WriteLine("Invalid Input");
                    break;
            }
            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}

```
##### **Is default block Mandatory in a Switch Statement?**
No, the default block in the switch statement is not mandatory. If you are putting the default block and if any of the case statement is not fulfilled, then only the default block is going to be executed. For a better understanding, please have a look at the below example where we don’t have the default block.

```c#
using System;
namespace ControlFlowDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            string str = "C#2";
            Console.WriteLine("Switch Statement Started");
            switch (str)
            {
                case "C#":      
                case "Java":
                case "C":
                    Console.WriteLine("It's a Programming Language");
                    break;

                case "MSSQL":
                case "MySQL":
                case "Oracle":
                    Console.WriteLine("It's a Database");
                    break;

                case "MVC":
                case "WEB API":
                    Console.WriteLine("It's a Framework");
                    break;
            }
            Console.WriteLine("Switch Statement Ended");
            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}

```

##### **Why do we use Switch Statements instead of if-else statements in C#?**

We use the switch statement instead of if-else statements because an if-else statement only works for a small number of logical evaluations of a value. If you use an if-else statement for a larger number of possible conditions then, it takes more time to write and also becomes difficult to understand. For a better understanding, please have a look at the below example. Here, we have written multiple if-else conditions, and, in each condition, we have written the complex expression which not only makes you confused but also it is very difficult to understand.


```C#
using System;
namespace ControlFlowDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            string category;

            // taking topic name
            string topic = "Inheritance";

            if ( topic.Equals("Introduction to C#") ||
                topic.Equals("Variables") ||
                topic.Equals("Data Types"))
            {
                category = "Basic";
            }

            else if (topic.Equals("Loops") ||
                topic.Equals("If ELSE Statements") ||
                topic.Equals("Jump Statements"))
            {
                category = "Control Flow";
            }

            else if (topic.Equals("Inheritance") ||
                topic.Equals("Polymorphism") ||
                topic.Equals("Abstraction") ||
                topic.Equals("Encapsulation"))
            {
                category = "OOPS Concept";
            }
            else
            {
                category = "Invalid";
            }

            Console.Write($"{topic} Category is {category}");
            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}

```

As you can see in the above example, the code is not excessive but, it looks complicated to read and took more time to write. So, instead of using if-else conditions, we can also use a switch statement to save time which is also easier to understand because using a switch statement will provide better readability of code. Let us rewrite the previous example Using Switch Statement in C# language.

```C#
using System;
namespace ControlFlowDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            string category;

            // taking topic name
            string topic = "Inheritance";

            // using switch Statement
            switch (topic)
            {
                case "Introduction to C#":
                case "Variables":
                case "Data Types":
                    category = "Basic";
                    break;
                case "Loops":
                case "If ELSE Statements":
                case "Jump Statements":
                    category = "Control Flow";
                    break;
                case "Inheritance":
                case "Polymorphism":
                case "Abstraction":
                case "Encapsulation":
                    category = "OOPS Concept";
                    break;
                // default case 
                default:
                    category = "Invalid";
                    break;
            }

            Console.Write($"{topic} Category is {category}");
            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}

```

**Note:** Even though the nested switch statement is allowed, it is not recommended by Microsoft to use nested switch statements. The reason is that the nested switch statements will make your code more complex and less readable.


# Loops in C# #


##### **Loops in C#:**

Loops are also called repeating statements or iterative statements. Loops play an important role in programming. The Looping Statements are also called Iteration Statements. So, we can use the word Looping and Iteration and the meanings are the same.

##### **What is looping?**

Looping in programming languages is a feature that facilitates the execution of a set of instructions repeatedly while some condition evaluates to true.

The process of repeatedly executing a statement or group of statements until the condition is satisfied is called looping. In this case, when the condition becomes false the execution of the loops terminates. The way it repeats the execution of the statements or instructions will form a circle that’s why iteration statements are called loops.

So, in simple words, we can say that Loop is nothing but repeating some tasks for some amount of time until the condition is true. There are two types of loops

1. **Counter Loops**
2. **Conditional Loops**

Before explaining, what are the counter and conditional loops let’s make you understand where we see loops in reality with real-time examples.


##### **Loops Exist in our Daily Life.**

Every day I woke up at 6 ->go jogging ->come home->take a bath->had breakfast-> went to college/office-> worked/learn->come back at 6-> watched tv/mobile->had dinner -> went to sleep this routine is repeated every day without change and this we call it has loops in programming.

Here when you wake up tomorrow you will do the same thing and this continues until you are alive. So here condition to break the loop is you have to die. Now let us explain what is the counter loop and conditional Loop.

1. **Counter Loops** are the loops, which execute a specific set of instructions a certain number of times. Example: Token system followed in hospitals where the whole intention could be getting the headcount of patients.
2. **Conditional Loops** are the loops, which execute a specific task until the condition is true. Example: Attend the online classes until the covid-19 situation comes to control.

##### **Why do we need looping?**

The basic purpose of the loop is code repetition. So, whenever the repetitions are required, then in place of writing the statements, again and again, we need to go for looping.

The whole intention of using loops in programming is to make the developer’s job easy and make the code look clean and efficient. The developer goes for loops whenever he wants to execute some instructions a certain number of times. To give you a better understanding of the importance of loops in programming let us write a code without loops and with loops.


##### **Example to print numbers from 1 to 10 without using the loop in C#**

```C#
using System;
namespace ControlFlowDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("1");
            Console.WriteLine("2");
            Console.WriteLine("3");
            Console.WriteLine("4");
            Console.WriteLine("5");
            Console.WriteLine("6");
            Console.WriteLine("7");
            Console.WriteLine("8");
            Console.WriteLine("9");
            Console.WriteLine("10");

            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}

```


**Note:** Even though we are able to print the numbers from 1 to 10, the code doesn’t look good as the same instruction is written multiple times also what is it if want to print from 1 to 1000? Or from 1 to 100000? So, without loops, the code not even looks understandable and efficient.

##### **Program to Print 1 to N with a loop in C#**

```C#
using System;
namespace ControlFlowDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            for(int i=1; i <=10; i++)
            {
                Console.WriteLine(i);
            }
            
            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}

```

##### **Types of Loops in C#**

Iteration statements create loops in the program. It repeats the same code several times until a specified condition is satisfied. Iteration statements execute the same set of instructions until a termination condition is met. There are four types of looping statements in C#. They are as follows:

1. **For loop**
2. **For Each Loop**
3. **While loop**
4. **Do while loop**

##### **Flowchart of Loop:**

Let us understand the flowchart of the loop step by step for a better understanding.

###### **Step1:**

This is the starting point of the flowchart.

![[flowchart-of-loop.webp]]

###### **Step2:**

Here we are taking the input from the user, whatever the problem is, and some input it is taking.

![[flowchart-of-loop-1.webp]]

###### **Step3:**

It is processing the input.

![[flowchart-of-loop-2.webp]]

**Step4:**
![[flowchart-of-loops-in-c.webp]]

As the input is processed then it checks for the condition, if the condition is true then again it goes back and processing will do and then again check for the condition, if the condition is true then again goes back, and so on.

This will be repeated. So, this processing part will go on repeating as long as that condition is true and once the conditions become false it will come out from here and print the output.

###### **Step5:**

![[flowchart-of-loops-in-c-1.webp]]

##### **Realtime Example:**

This type of thing we do commonly in our daily life repeatedly. We perform some steps like you have a coffee and you have to add some sugar in that. So, you’ll put some sugar and check it. If it’s not sweet yet then we will put some more sugar and check again. If it is sufficiently sweet then you will stop adding the sugar. So, this is a repeating procedure.

Let us take one more example. You are walking towards your home. If you have not reached home then take a step walk and then walk and check, have you reached home? No, then take one or more steps and check again. If yes, stop walking, and if no, you will be going on taking steps.

1. **while**
2. **do-while**
3. **for**
4. **for each**


### **While Loop in C# Language:**

![[Pasted image 20240415115017.png]]

While we are working with a while loop first, we need to check the condition, if the condition is true then the control will pass within the body and if the condition is false the control will pass outside the body.

When we are working with an iteration statement after execution of the body control will be passed back to the condition, and until the condition become false. If the condition is not false then we will get an infinite loop.

##### **Flow Chart of While Loop in C# Language:**

![[flow-chart-of-while-loop-in-c-language.webp]]

The flow chart will start. The start is represented by the oval symbol. Then it will check the condition. As discussed earlier, every condition is having two outputs i.e. true and false. If it is true what will happen and it is false what will happen, we need to check.

Suppose, the condition is true, then what all statements defined inside the block (within the while loop block) will execute. After execution of statements, will it end? NO, it will not end. After execution of statements, once again it will go and check the condition. It will repeat the same process as long as the given condition is true. Suppose, the condition is false, then it will come to end. This is the execution flow of a while loop.
##### **Example to understand While loop in C# Language:**

                x++;

            n = Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine());
            i = 2;
            while (i <= n)
            {
                Console.Write($"{i} ");
                i = i + 2;
            }

            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}

        {

            Console.Write("Enter a Number : ");
            n = Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine());
            i = 0;
            j = 1;
            Console.Write($"{i} {j}");
           
            k = i + j;
            while (k <= n)
            {
                Console.Write($" {k}");
                
                i = j;
                j = k;
                k = i + j;
            }

            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}

```

##### **Nested While Loop in C# Programming Language:**

Writing a while loop inside another while loop is called nested while loop or you can say defining one while loop inside another while loop is called nested while loop. This is the reason why nested loops are also called “loops inside the loop”. There can be any number of loops inside one another with any of the three combinations depending on the complexity of the given problem. In implementation when we need to repeat the loop body itself n number of times then we need to go for nested loops.

![[nested-while-loop-in-c-programming-language.webp]]

##### **Execution Flow of Nested While Loop in C# Language:**

The outer while loop executes based on the outer condition and the inner while loop executes based on the inner condition. Now let us understand how the nested while loop executes. First, it will check the outer loop condition and if the outer loop condition fails, then it will terminate the loop.

Suppose the outer loop condition is true, then it will come inside, first, it will print the outer loop statements which are there before the inner loop. Then it will check the inner loop condition. If the inner while condition is true, then the control move inside and executes the inner while loop statements. After execution of inner while loop statements, again, it will check the inner while loop condition because it is a loop and as long as the condition is true, it will repeat this process. Once the inner while loop condition fails, then the control moves outside and executes the statements which are present after the inner while loop. Once it executes then, again it will go and check the outer while loop condition. And if it is true, then it will again execute the same process. So, when the loop will terminate means when the outer while loop condition becomes false.

##### **Flow Chart of Nested While Loop:**

Please have a look at the following diagram, which represents the flow chart of the nested while loop.

### **Do while loop in C# Language:**

The do-while loop is a post-tested loop or exit-controlled loop i.e. first it will execute the loop body and then it will be going to test the condition. That means we need to use the do-while loop where we need to execute the loop body at least once. The do-while loop is mainly used in menu-driven programs where the termination condition depends upon the end-user.

##### **Syntax to use Do While Loop in C# Language:**

The following image shows the syntax to use the do while loop in the C# language. The loop is created by using the do keyword followed by open and close curly braces. In between the open and close curly braces, you can write the statements which you want to execute at least once. And after the close curly braces, you need to write the while condition. Please note that the while condition statement ends with a semicolon. The condition expression must be a boolean expression.

![[do-while-loop-syntax-in-c-language.webp]]

##### **While and do-while are almost the same. So, what is the difference? Which one do we use?**

The difference between the do-while loop and the while loop in C# is that the do-while evaluates its test condition at the bottom of the loop whereas the while loop evaluates its test condition at the top. Therefore, the statements written inside the do-while block are executed at least once whereas we cannot give a guarantee that the statements written inside the while loop are going to be executed at least once.

**Note:** When you want to execute the loop body at least once irrespective of the condition, then you need to use the do-while loop else you need to use the while loop.

![[Flow-Chart-of-Do-While-Loop.webp]]

##### **Example to understand do while loop in C# Language:**

```C#
using System;
namespace ControlFlowDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            int number = 1;
            do
            {
                Console.Write($"{number} ");
                number++;
            } while (number <= 5);

            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}

namespace ControlFlowDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)

                {
                    Console.WriteLine("I am from inner do-while loop ");
                }
                while (1 > 10);
            }
            while (2 > 10);

            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}

```

##### **Realtime Example of Do-While Loop in C#:**

Let us understand do while loop with one real-time example. The do-while loop is mainly used in menu-driven programs where the termination condition depends upon the end-user. That means when the end user wants then the loop is going to terminate. 

For a better understanding, please have a look at the following example. In the below example, we are using a do while loop, and inside the do while loop we are using a switch case statement. Here, first, we are asking the user to select the options i.e. what operation he wants to perform. The options are 1 for Addition, 2 for Subtraction, 3 for Multiplication, and 4 for Division. Based on the selected options, we are executing the matched case statement and performing the required operations. Once the operation is performed then we are not terminating the loop instead we are asking the user whether he wants to continue or wants to terminate. If he enters the letter y, then again, we are showing the options to select and perform the desired operation and if he enters anything other than y, then the loop will be terminated and will end the program.

```C#
using System;
namespace ControlFlowDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            char Choice;
            int MenuOption;
            int Number1, Number2;
            do
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Press 1 for Addition, 2 for Subtraction, 3 for Multiplication, 4 for Division");
                MenuOption = Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine());
                switch (MenuOption)
                {
                    case 1:
                        Console.WriteLine("Enter the value of two numbers");
                        Number1 = Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine());
                        Number2 = Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine());
                        Console.WriteLine($"Sum Is {Number1 + Number2}");
                        break;
                    case 2:
                        Console.WriteLine("Enter the value of two numbers");
                        Number1 = Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine());
                        Number2 = Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine());
                        Console.WriteLine($"Difference Is {Number1 - Number2}");
                        break;
                    case 3:
                        Console.WriteLine("Enter the value of two numbers");
                        Number1 = Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine());
                        Number2 = Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine());
                        Console.WriteLine($"Multiplication Is {Number1 * Number2}");
                        break;
                    case 4:
                        Console.WriteLine("Enter the value of two numbers");
                        Number1 = Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine());
                        Number2 = Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine());
                        Console.WriteLine($"Division Is {Number1 / Number2}");
                        break;
                    default:
                        Console.WriteLine("Invalid choice");
                        break;
                }
                Console.WriteLine("Please Enter Y to continue, any keys to terminate");

                Choice = Convert.ToChar(Console.ReadLine());
            }
            while (Char.ToUpper(Choice) == 'Y');
        }
    }
}

```

##### **For Loop in C#:**

For loop is one of the most commonly used loops in the C# language. If we know the number of times, we want to execute some set of statements or instructions, then we should use for loop. For loop is known as a Counter loop. Whenever counting is involved for repetition, then we need to use for loop.

Let’s take an example and try to understand what it means by counting. Suppose you are preparing coffee. You don’t know how to prepare coffee; somebody has given you instructions and you’re following them. You are making coffee for 4 people.

Now the question is how much sugar you should add? You don’t know exactly how much sugar you need to add. So, what you will do, you will add some sugar and mix it and check whether the coffee is sweet, if it is not sweet enough, then again you will add some sugar and mix, and so on until the coffee becomes sweet enough. So, how many times you should add sugar to coffee? It has no fixed answer because you will add sugar to coffee until it becomes sweet enough. So, this is not based on counting. This is based on condition. The condition is until and unless the coffee is not sweet enough, you continue adding sugar and mix it.

Now somebody gives you instructions that add 4 tablespoons of sugar to make the coffee for four people. So, this is based on counting. There are many examples in daily life. We do things a fixed number of times. So, when you have to repeat the steps based on counting, then you need to use for loop.


##### **For Loop Flowchart**

The following diagram shows the flowchart of the for loop.

![[For-Loop-Flowchart-in-C.webp]]

##### **Syntax to use For Loop in C# Language:**

The **for loop** allows the execution of instructions for a specific amount of time. It has four stages.

1. **Loop initialization**
2. **Condition evaluation**
3. **Execution of instruction**
4. **Increment/Decrement**
![[word-image-190.webp]]

###### **Explanation of the for-loop syntax:**

1. **Loop Initialization:** Loop initialization happens only once while executing the for loop, which means that the initialization part of for loop only executes once. Here, initialization means we need to initialize the counter variable.
2. **Condition Evaluation:** Conditions in for loop are executed for each iteration and if the condition is true, it executes the C# instruction and if the condition is false then it comes out of the loop.
3. **Execution of Instruction:** Once the condition is evaluated, and if the condition is true, then the control comes to the loop body i.e. the loop body is going to be executed.
4. **Increment/Decrement**: After executing the loop body, the increment/decrement part of the for loop will be executed, and once it executes the increment decrement part i.e. once it increments and decrements the counter variable, again it will go to the condition evaluation stage.
```C#
using System;
namespace ControlFlowDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.Write("Enter one Integer Number:");
            int number = Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine());
            for (int counter = 1; counter <= number; counter++)
            {
                Console.WriteLine(counter);
            }
            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}

```

```C#
using System;
namespace ControlFlowDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.Write("Enter one Integer Number:");
            int number = Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine());
            int counter = 1; //Initialization
            for (;counter <= number;)
            {
                Console.WriteLine(counter);
                counter++; //Updation
            }
            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}
```

##### **Infinite Loop in C#:**

In our previous example, we have seen that we can place the increment/decrement statement in the body part. But what happens, if we don’t give any increment/decrement statement in for loop or in the body? It will be an infinite loop. An infinite loop is a never-ending loop. For a better understanding, please have a look at the below example. In the below example, we don’t have the increment/decrement statement, so for loop is not going to end and hence will result in an infinite loop.

```C#

            int number = 10;
            int i = 1;
            for (; i <= number; )
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Hello C#");

##### **Can we run for loop without condition in C#?**

Yes, we can run a for loop without condition. And, it will be an infinite loop. Because if we don’t mention any termination condition in for loop, the for loop is not going to end. For a better understanding, please have a look at the below example.

```C#
using System;
namespace ControlFlowDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            for (int i = 1; ; i++)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Hello C#");
            }
        }
    }
}


```

**We can write a custom if statement inside for loop as:**

```C#
using System;
namespace ControlFlowDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            int i = 1;
            for (;; )
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Hello C#");
                i++;
                if (i > 5)
                    break;
            }
            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}

```

##### **Nested for Loop in C#:**

![[nested-for-loop-in-c-language.webp]]

**Note:** The point that you need to remember is when the inner for loop condition failed, then it will terminate the inner for loop only. And when the outer for loop condition failed, then it will terminate the outer for loop.

```C#
using System;
namespace ControlFlowDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) //Outer For Loop
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"Outer For Loop : {i}");
                for (int j = 1; j <= 10; j++) //Inner For Loop
                {
                    Console.Write($" {j}");
                }
                Console.WriteLine();
            }

            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}

```

##### **Program to enter a number and check whether that no is the perfect number or not using for loop in C#**

A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its positive divisors, excluding the number itself. For instance, 6 has divisors 1, 2 and 3, and 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, so 6 is a perfect number.

```C#
using System;
namespace ControlFlowDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            int number, i, sum = 0;
            Console.Write("Enter a Number :");
            number = Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine());

            for (i = 1; i <= number / 2; i++)
            {
                if (number % i == 0)
                    sum += i;
            }
            if (sum == number && number != 0)
                Console.WriteLine($"{number} is a Perfect Number");
            else
                Console.WriteLine($"{number} is not a Perfect Number");

            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}

```

##### **Program to enter a number and check whether it is a prime number or not using for loop in C# Language**

A Prime Number is a number that should be greater than 1 and it is only divided by 1 and itself. In other words, we can say that the prime numbers can’t be divided by other numbers than itself and 1. For example, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, and 23…., are the prime numbers.

```C#
using System;
namespace ControlFlowDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            int number, i;
            Console.Write("Enter a Number :");
            number = Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine());

            for (i = 2; i < number; i++)
            {
                if (number % i == 0)
                {
                    break;
                }
                    
            }
            if (i == number && number >= 2)
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"{number} is a Prime Number");
            }
                
            else
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"{number} is not a Prime Number");
            }

            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}
```

##### **How does the break statement work in C# language?**

In our switch case conditional statement, we have discussed how to use the break statement. Now, let us understand how to use the break statement inside the loop and how the break statement exactly works in C#. To understand this, please have a look at the following image. Here, I am showing how to use the break statement inside do while, while. and for loop and how exactly the break statement work.

![[How-does-the-break-statement-work-in-C-language-1.webp]]

##### **Example to Understand Break Statement in C# Language:**

In the below example, we have provided the condition for the loop to be executed 10 times i.e. starting from I value 1 to 10. But our requirement is when the I value becomes 5, we need to terminate the loop. In this case, we need to write if condition inside the loop body and check whether the current I value is equal to 5 or not. If it is not equal to 5, then continue the execution of the for loop and execute the next iteration. But if the I value is 5, then the, if condition will return true, and, in that case, the break statement will be executed and once the break statement is executed, it will immediately terminate the loop body. So, the next statement which is present after the loop body is going to execute.

```C#
using System;
namespace JumpStatementDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++)
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"I : {i}");
                if (i == 5)
                {
                    break;
                }
            }
            Console.WriteLine("Out of for-loop");

            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}

```

##### **C# Break Statement with Inner Loop:**

The break statement in C# terminates the closest enclosing iteration statement (for, for each, while, or do loop) or switch statement. If we place the break statement inside the nested loop i.e. inside the inner loop, then the break statement will terminate only the innermost loop that contains it.

For a better understanding, please have a look at the below example. Here, the outer loop will execute 5 times. Again, for each outer loop iteration, we have written the inner for loop condition to execute 5 times. But, inside the inner loop body, we have written the break statement using the if condition, and when the inner value is equal to 3, it will break the inner loop.

```C#
using System;
namespace JumpStatementDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            for (int outer = 1; outer <= 5; outer++)
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"Outer: {outer}");
                for (int inner = 1; inner <= 5; inner++)
                {
                    if (inner > 3)
                    {
                        break;
                    }
                    Console.Write($"  Inner: {inner}");
                }
                Console.WriteLine();
            }

            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}
```

The point that you need to remember is the break statement will terminate the inner loop body only. Once the inner loop is terminated, it will continue the execution of the outer loop body and will also continue with the execution of the next iteration of the outer loop. When you execute the above code, you will get the following output.

##### **Break Statement with Loop and Switch Statements in C#:**

```C#
using System;
namespace JumpStatementDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            double[] measurements = { 1, 20, 3, double.NaN };
            foreach (double measurement in measurements)
            {
                switch (measurement)
                {
                    case 1:
                        Console.WriteLine($"value is {measurement}; too low.");
                        break;

                    case 20:
                        Console.WriteLine($"value is {measurement}; too high.");
                        break;

                    case double.NaN:
                        Console.WriteLine("Invalid");
                        break;

                    default:
                        Console.WriteLine($"Value is {measurement}.");
                        break;
                }
            }
            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}

```

In General, we should minimize the use of break statements in loops. The switch statement is an exception in this regard where it is necessary to use the “break statement” after every case. Otherwise, there may be a logical error. while writing loops, we should try to execute the loops with the condition test and should try to avoid the “break statement”.

**Question1: What will be the output in the below program?**

```C#

## Continue Statement in C# #

In C#, continue is a keyword. By using the continue keyword, we can skip the statement execution from the loop body. Like the [**break statement**](https://dotnettutorials.net/lesson/break-statement-in-csharp/), the use of the continue statement is also optional but if you want to use then you can use it only within the loop body.

##### **Using Continue Statement inside the nested loop:**

The continue statement starts a new iteration of the closest enclosing iteration statement (for, for each, while, or do loop). For a better understanding, please have a look at the below example. Here, the outer loop will execute 5 times. Again, for each outer loop iteration, we have written the inner for loop condition to execute 5 times. But, inside the inner loop body, we have written the continue statement using the if condition, and when the inner value is equal to 3, it will skip the remaining statement execution.

```C#
using System;
namespace JumpStatementDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            for (int outer = 1; outer <= 5; outer++)
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"Outer: {outer}");
                for (int inner = 1; inner <= 5; inner++)
                {
                    if (inner == 3)
                    {
                        continue;
                    }
                    Console.Write($"  Inner: {inner}");
                }
                Console.WriteLine();
            }

            {
                Console.WriteLine($"Outer: {outer}");
                for (int inner = 1; inner <= 5; inner++)
                {

            }

            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}
```

We should avoid using “Continue Statement” where it’s possible. The continue statement executes some statements of the loop and then exits the loop without executing some statements after it. We can use the if statement for this purpose instead of continue. In the below example, we are not using the continue statement, using the if condition only we are achieving the same output.
