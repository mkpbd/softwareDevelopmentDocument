##### **Example to Get String Input from User in C#:**

```C#
using System;
namespace FirstProgram
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            string str;

## **String in C# with Examples**

##### **Strings are reference types in C#:**

Strings in C# are reference types i.e. they are not normal data types or you can say they are not like other primitive data types. For example, if we define some variables using int or double data types as shown below.

![[word-image-31.webp]]

Then if you right-click on the data type and go to the definition then you will see that they are struct as shown in the below image. Struct means they are value type.

![[word-image-32.webp]]

On the other hand, if you define a variable with string data type as shown below.



![[word-image-33 1.webp]]

Then if you right-click on the string data type and click on go to definition then you will see that it is a class. Class means reference data type.

![[word-image-34 1.webp]]
##### **What are the Differences between String(Capital) vs string(small) in C#?**

![[word-image-35 1.webp]]
Now the question that should come to your mind is what is the difference between these two (string vs String) in C#. Let’s understand this. The small string is actually an alias of String (Capital string). If you right-click on the small string and if you go to the definition then you will see that the actual class name is a capital string i.e. String as shown in the below image.

![[word-image-36 1.webp]]

![[word-image-37 1.webp]]

##### **Strings are Immutable in C#:**

Before understanding strings are immutable, first, we need to understand two terms i.e. Mutable and Immutable. Mutable means can be changed whereas Immutable means can not be changed. C# strings are immutable means C# strings cannot be changed. Let us understand this with an example.

Please have a look at the below image. When the first statement is executed, it will create one object and assign the value DotNet. But when the second statement is executed, it will not override the first object, it lets the first object be there for garbage collection and creates a fresh object, and assign the value Tutorials.

![[word-image-38.webp]]

So, when the above two statements are executed, internally two memory locations are created. When the first statement is executed, one object will be created which holds the value DotNet and that object will be referred to by the str variable. When the second statement will be executed, another object will be created which holds the value Tutorials and now the str variable will point to this newly created object. And the first object will be there and will be available for garbage collection. So, the point that you need to remember is that each time, we assign a new value to the string variable, a new object is created and that new object will be referred to by the string variable and older objects will be there for garbage collection and this is the reason why said strings are immutable in C#.
![[Strings-are-Immutable-in-C.webp]]



But this is not the case with a value type. For example, please have a look at the below two statements. When the first statement is executed one memory location is created and assigned the value 100 and when the second statement is executed, it will not create a new memory location rather it will override the value of the same memory location.

![[Value-Types-are-Mutable.webp]]

### **C# strings are Immutable:**

Let us see an example to understand C# strings are Immutable. Please copy and paste the following code. As you can see here we have a heavy loop. As part of the Loop, we assign a value to the string str variable. Here, we are using GUID to generate a new value, and each time it will create a new value and assign it to the str variable. Again, we are using Stopwatch to check how much time it took to execute the loop.

```C#
using System;
using System.Diagnostics;

namespace StringDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            string str = "";
            Console.WriteLine("Loop Started");
            var stopwatch = new Stopwatch();

            stopwatch.Start();
            for (int i = 0; i < 30000000; i++)
            {
                 str = Guid.NewGuid().ToString();
            }
            stopwatch.Stop();

            Console.WriteLine("Loop Ended");
            Console.WriteLine("Loop Exceution Time in MS :" + stopwatch.ElapsedMilliseconds);

            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}
```

### **using Integer in C#:**

In the following C# example, instead of a string, we are using an integer variable. As integers are not immutable, so it will not create a fresh memory location each time the loop executes instead it will use the same memory location and update its value.

```C#
using System;
using System.Diagnostics;

namespace StringDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            int ctr =0;
            Console.WriteLine("Loop Started");
            var stopwatch = new Stopwatch();

            stopwatch.Start();
            for (int i = 0; i < 30000000; i++)
            {
                ctr = ctr + 1;
            }
            stopwatch.Stop();

            Console.WriteLine("Loop Ended");
            Console.WriteLine("Loop Exceution Time in MS :" + stopwatch.ElapsedMilliseconds);

            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}

```

##### **String with Same value in C#**

```C#
using System;
using System.Diagnostics;

namespace StringDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            string str = "";
            Console.WriteLine("Loop Started");
            var stopwatch = new Stopwatch();

            stopwatch.Start();
            for (int i = 0; i < 30000000; i++)
            {
                str ="DotNet Tutorials";
            }
            stopwatch.Stop();

            Console.WriteLine("Loop Ended");
            Console.WriteLine("Loop Exceution Time in MS :" + stopwatch.ElapsedMilliseconds);

            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}
```

##### **StringBuilder for Concatenation in C#:**

 The C# string immutability behavior can be very very dangerous when it comes to string concatenation. Let us understand string concatenation in C# with an example and understand the problem. In the below example, we are concatenating the string using the for loop.

```C#
using System;
using System.Diagnostics;

namespace StringDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            string str = "";
            Console.WriteLine("Loop Started");
            var stopwatch = new Stopwatch();

            stopwatch.Start();
            for (int i = 0; i < 30000; i++)
            {
                str ="DotNet Tutorials" + str;
            }
            stopwatch.Stop();

            Console.WriteLine("Loop Ended");
            Console.WriteLine("Loop Exceution Time in MS :" + stopwatch.ElapsedMilliseconds);

            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}
```

As you can see in the above image, it took approximately 5473 milliseconds to execute the loop. In order to understand how it executes the loop, please have a look at the below image. The loop executes the first time, it will create a new memory location and store the value “DotNet Tutorials”. For the second time, it creates another fresh memory location (fresh object) and stores the value “DotNet Tutorials DotNet Tutorials” and the first memory location will be going for garbage collection. And the same process will continue i.e. each time the loop executes a new memory location will be created and previous ones will be going for garbage collection.
![[word-image-44.webp]]

In order to solve the above **String Concatenation Problem in C#**, the .NET Framework provides the **StringBuilder** class. As the name itself says everything, the string builder class in C# is used to build a string by concatenating the strings. If you use string builder then fresh objects are not going to be created every time you concatenate something to the string variable in C#.

##### **Example using StringBuilder in C#:**

Let us understand how to overcome the **String Concatenation Problem in C#** using the **StringBuilder** class. In the following example, we are using the StringBuilder class to concatenate strings. Here, first, we create an instance of the StringBuilder class and then use the **Append** method of the **StringBuilder** class to concatenate the string.

```C#
using System;
using System.Diagnostics;
using System.Text;

namespace StringDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            StringBuilder stringBuilder = new StringBuilder();
            Console.WriteLine("Loop Started");
            var stopwatch = new Stopwatch();

            stopwatch.Start();
            for (int i = 0; i < 30000; i++)
            {
                stringBuilder.Append("DotNet Tutorials");
            }
            stopwatch.Stop();

            Console.WriteLine("Loop Ended");
            Console.WriteLine("Loop Exceution Time in MS :" + stopwatch.ElapsedMilliseconds);

            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}
```

##### **Why do they make C# String Immutable?**

Now the question is why they made strings as Immutable in C#. **They made Strings Immutable for Thread Safety**. Think of one situation where you have many threads and all the threads want to manipulate the same string object as shown in the below image. If strings are mutable then we have thread-safety issues.

## **Static Keyword in C#**

If you ask this question to any developers, they most probably answer you that the static keyword is used in Factory Design Pattern, Singleton Design Pattern as well as used for data sharing, etc. But I think, the static keyword is used for three basic purposes. And in this article, we will discuss these three purposes in detail. I hope you are going to enjoy this article.

```C#
namespace StaticKeyowrdDemo
{
    public class CountryMaster
    {
        public string CountryCode { get; set; }
        public string CountryName { get; set; }
        private string ComputerName
        {
            get
            {
                return System.Environment.MachineName;
            }
        }
        public void Insert()
        {
            //Logic to Insert the Country Details into the Database
            //ComputerName property tells from which computer the Record is being Inserted
        }
    }
}
```

##### **Customer.cs**

```C#
namespace StaticKeyowrdDemo
{
    public class Customer
    {
        public string CustomerCode { get; set; }
        public string CustomerName { get; set; }
        private string MachineName = "";
        private bool IsEmpty(string value)
        {
            if(value.Length > 0)
            {
                return true;
            }

            return false;
        }        
        public void Insert()
        {
            if(IsEmpty(CustomerCode) && IsEmpty(CustomerName))
            {
                //Insert the data
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In the above code, the CustomerCode property is going to hold the three-letter code of the customer, for example, AB1 while the CustomerName property holds the customer’s name for example Pranaya. The IsEmpty method accepts one value and then checks if the value is empty or not. If not empty then return true else return false. The Insert method simply checks if both CustomerCode and CustomerName are not empty then insert the customer record into the database.

Here, the problem is with the MachineName variable. The MachineName should have the current computer name while inserting the customer data into the database so that we can track from which machine this customer data was inserted.

If you remember, the CountryMaster class has the logic to retrieve the computer name. Rather than writing the duplicate logic here, we should go and use the logic which is already written in the CountryMaster class, so that we can avoid rewriting the same code.

If you check the ComputerName property in the class CountryMaster class, then you will see that it is private. So, in order to use that property inside the Customer class, first of all, we need to change that property to the public as shown in the below image.

##### **How we are Violating the OOPs Principle?**

Let us understand how we are violating the OOPs Principle in our code. Now, please modify the Program class as shown below. Once you created the Customer class object, and when you write the object name and dot operator, then the intelligence will show you all the public members of the Customer class as shown in the below image.

![[DotNet/CShapr/images/word-image-49.webp]]
As you can see in the above image, we have exposed the CustomerCode, CustomerName, Insert, and IsEmpty methods. There is a clear violation of the Abstraction OOPs Principle. Abstraction means showing only what is necessary. So, the external person who is consuming your class, should see and consume the CustomerCode, CustomerName, and Insert method. But should not see the IsEmpty method. The IsEmpty method is for internal use i.e. used by other internal methods of the class and not by the consumer of the class. In this case, the Program class is the consumer of the Customer class i.e. Program class is going to consume the Customer class. As we make the IsEmpty method as public, we are violating the OOPs principle.

In the same way, we are also violating the abstraction principle with the CountryMaster object as we are exposing the ComputerName property to the external world. The ComputerName property is for internal use. That is while inserting the data, it will have the logic to get the computer name and store the same in the database. But, here the consumer of the CountryMaster class can also access and set and get the ComputerName property as shown in the below image. The ComputerName property is for internal use only.

![[word-image-50 1.webp]]

**Note:** With the above, we are achieving code reusability (reusing the ComputerName and IsEmpty method) but violating the OOPS principle.


##### **How to solve the above problem?**

How to solve the above problem means how we achieve code reusability without violating the OOPs principles. In order to achieve both, let us add a new class and then move those two functions into that class. Create a class file with the name **CommonTask.cs** and then copy and paste the following code into it.

```C#
namespace StaticKeyowrdDemo
{
    public class CommonTask
    {
        public bool IsEmpty(string value)
        {
            if (value.Length > 0)
            {
                return true;
            }

            return false;
        }

        public string GetComputerName()
        {
            return System.Environment.MachineName;
        }
    }
}
```

##### **Modifying Customer Class:**

```C#
namespace StaticKeyowrdDemo
{
    public class Customer
    {
        public string CustomerCode { get; set; }
        public string CustomerName { get; set; }
        private string MachineName = "";

        public Customer()
        {
            CommonTask commonTask = new CommonTask();
            MachineName = commonTask.ComputerName;
        }

        public void Insert()
        {
            CommonTask commonTask = new CommonTask();
            if (!commonTask.IsEmpty(CustomerCode) && !commonTask.IsEmpty(CustomerName))
            {
                //Insert the data
            }
        }
    }
}

```

##### **Modifying the CountryMaster Class:**

Please modify the CountryMaster class as shown below. Here, we created the instance of CommonTask and then Invoke the ComputerName Property and IsEmpty methods.

```C#
namespace StaticKeyowrdDemo
{
    public class CountryMaster
    {
        public string CountryCode { get; set; }
        public string CountryName { get; set; }
        private string ComputerName
        {
            get
            {
                CommonTask commonTask = new CommonTask();
                return commonTask.ComputerName;
            }
        }

        public void Insert()
        {
            CommonTask commonTask = new CommonTask();
            if (!commonTask.IsEmpty(CountryCode) && !commonTask.IsEmpty(CountryName))
            {
                //Logic to Insert the Country Details into the Database
                //ComputerName property tells from which computer the Record is being Inserted
            }
        }
    }
}

```

##### **How do we avoid Inheritance, how do we avoid abstraction, or how do we avoid the OOPs principle in a class?**

The answer is by using the static keyword. So, what we need to do is, we need to mark the CommonTask class as static by using the static keyword. When we mark a class as static, then everything inside the class should also be static. That means, along with the class CommonTask, we also need to mark the IsEmpty method and ComputerName property as static. So, modify the CommonTask class as shown below.

```C#
namespace StaticKeyowrdDemo
{
    public static class CommonTask
    {
        public static bool IsEmpty(string value)
        {
            if (value.Length > 0)
            {
                return true;
            }

            return false;
        }

        public static string ComputerName
        {
            get
            {
                return System.Environment.MachineName;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Once you make the class static, then you cannot apply any kind of OOPs Principles even you cannot use the **new** keyword with the static class to create an instance rather you need to invoke the **IsEmpty** method and **ComputerName** property by using the class name directly. Internally only one instance of the static class gets created by CLR as soon as the class execution starts and the same single instance will be served by all clients.

##### **Modify the Customer Class:**

Now modify the Customer class as shown below. As you can see, now we are invoking the **ComputerName** property and **IsEmpty** method using the class name i.e. **CommonTask** directly without creating any instance.

```c#
namespace StaticKeyowrdDemo
{
    public class Customer
    {
        public string CustomerCode { get; set; }
        public string CustomerName { get; set; }
        private string MachineName = "";

        public Customer()
        {
            MachineName = CommonTask.GetComputerName();
        }
        
        public void Insert()
        {
            if(!CommonTask.IsEmpty(CustomerCode) && !CommonTask.IsEmpty(CustomerName))
            {
                //Insert the data
            }
        }
    }
}

```

##### **Modify the CountryMaster class:**

```C#
    public class CountryMaster
    {
        public string CountryCode { get; set; }
        public string CountryName { get; set; }
        private string ComputerName
        {
            get
            {
                return CommonTask.GetComputerName();
            }
        }

        public void Insert()
        {
            if (!CommonTask.IsEmpty(CountryCode) && !CommonTask.IsEmpty(CountryName))
            {
                //Insert the data
            }
        }
    }

```

##### **How is the Static Class Instantiated in C#?**

We cannot apply any OOPs principles to the static class like inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction. But in the end, it is a class. And at least to use a class it has to be instantiated. Why because once it is instantiated. then only the static members get memory allocation. Until and unless the memory is not allocated, we cannot access them. So, if the static class is not instantiated then we cannot invoke the methods and properties that are present inside the static class. Now let us see how the instantiation takes place internally of a static class i.e. in our example, it is the **CommonTask** class.

The CLR (Common Language Runtime) internally will create only one instance of the **CommonTask** class irrespective of how many times they called from the **Customer** and **CountryMaster** class. And it is going to be created for the first time when we use consume the **CommonTask** class. For a better understanding, please have a look at the below image.
