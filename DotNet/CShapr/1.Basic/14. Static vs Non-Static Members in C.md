##### **What are Static and Non-Static Members in C#?**

The member of a class is divided into two categories

1. **Static Members**
2. **Non-Static Members**

The members (Variables, Constructors, and Methods) which are created by using the static modifier are called static members rest of all are called non-static members.

In other words, we can also define that, the members of a class that does not require an instance either for initialization or execution are known as the static member. On the other hand, the members which require an instance of a class for both initialization and execution are known as non-static members.


![[Understanding-Static-and-Non-Static-Variables-in-C.webp]]

If you want a variable to have the same value throughout all instances of a class then you need to declare that variable as a static variable. So, the static variables are going to hold the application-level data which is going to be the same for all the objects. 

The static variable gets initialized immediately once the execution of the class starts whereas the non-static variables are initialized only after creating the object of the class and that is too for each time the object of the class is created.

A static variable gets initialized only once during the life cycle of a class whereas a non-static variable gets initialized either 0 or n number of times, depending on the number of objects created for that class.

If you want to access the static members of a class, then you need to access them directly within the same class and use the class name from outside the class whereas you need an instance of a class to access the non-static members.

```C#
    class Example
    {
        int x; // Non-Static Variable
        static int y = 200; //Static Variable
        public Example(int x)
        {
            //Initializing Non-Static Variable
            this.x = x;
        }
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            //Accessing Static Variable using class name
            //Before Object Creation
            Console.WriteLine($"Static Variable Y = {Example.y}");

            //Accessing Static Variable using without class name
            //It’s possible because we are accessing the variable
            //from the same class
            Console.WriteLine($"Static Variable Y = {y}");

            //Creating Object1
            Example obj1 = new Example(50);

            //Creating Object2
            Example obj2 = new Example(100);

            //Accessing Non-Static Variable using Object of the class
            Console.WriteLine($"Object1 x = {obj1.x} and Object2 x = {obj2.x}");
            Console.ReadLine();
        }
    }

```

##### **What is the Scope of Static and Non-Static Variables in C#?**

The Non-Static variables are created when the object is created and are destroyed when the object is destroyed. The object is destroyed when its reference variable is destroyed or initialized with null. So, we can say that the scope of the object is the scope of its referenced variables. On the other hand, the Static Variable scope is the Application Scope. What it means, as soon as the application start and class execution starts, static variables are created and they will be there as long as your application is running. Once the application stops, then static variables are going to be deleted. So, the scope is application scope.

##### **Static and Non-Static Methods in C#**

When we create a method by using the static modifier then it is called the static method and the rest of the methods are non-static methods. You cannot consume the non-static members directly within a static method. If you want to consume any non-static members with a static method then you need to create an object and then through the object, you can access the non-static members. On the other hand, you can directly consume the static members within a non-static method without any restriction.


##### **Rules to follow while working with Static and Non-Static Members in c#:**

1. **Non-Static to Static:** Non-Static Members can be consumed only by using the object of that class inside a static block.
2. **Static to Static:** Static Members can be consumed directly (within the same class) or by using the class name (from outside the class) inside another static block.
3. **Static to Non-Static:** Static Members can be consumed directly or by using the class name inside a Non-Static block.
4. **Non-Static to Non-Static:** Non-Static Members can be consumed directly or by using the “this” keyword inside another non-static block.

##### **Understand Static and Non-Static Methods in C#**

```C#

    class Example
    {
        int x = 100;
        static int y = 200;
        static void Add()
        {
            //This is a static block
            //we can access non static members X with the help of Example object
            //We can access the static member directly or through class name
            Example obj = new Example();
            //Console.WriteLine(obj.x + Example.y);
            Console.WriteLine("Sum of 100 and 200 is :" + (obj.x + y));
            Console.WriteLine("Sum of 100 and 200 is :" + (obj.x + Example.y));
        }

        void Mul()
        {
            //This is a Non-Static method
            //we can access static members directly or through class name
            //we can access the non-static members directly or through this keyword
            Console.WriteLine("Multiplication of 100 and 200 is :" + (this.x * Example.y));
            Console.WriteLine("Multiplication of 100 and 200 is :" + (x * y));
        }
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            // Main method is a static method
            // ADD() method is a static method
            // Statid to Static 
            // we can call the add method directly or through class name
            Example.Add(); //Calling Add Method using Class Name
            Add(); //Calling Add Method Directly

            // Mul() method is a Non-Static method
            // We can call the non-static method using object only from a static method
            // Static to Non-Static
            Example obj = new Example();
            obj.Mul(); //Calling Mul Method using Instance
            Console.ReadLine();
        }
    }

```

#####  **Understand Static and Non-Static Constructors in C#**

```C#

    class Example
    {
        //Static Constructor
        //Executed only once
        //First block of code to be executed inside a class
        //Before Main Method body start executing, this constructor will execute
        static Example()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Static Constructor is Called");
        }

        //Non-Static Constructor
        //Executed once per object
        //When we create an instance, this constructor will execute
        public Example()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Non-Static Constructor is Called");
        }

        //Program Execution will start from the Main method
        //But before executing the Main method body, it will
        //execute the static constructor
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Main Method Execution Start");
            Example obj1 = new Example();
            Example obj2 = new Example();
            Console.WriteLine("Main Method Execution End");
            Console.ReadLine();
        }
    }

```

##### **Understand Static Class in C#**

```C#

    public static class TemperatureConverter
    {
        public static double CelsiusToFahrenheit(string temperatureCelsius)
        {
            // Convert argument to double for calculations.
            double celsius = Double.Parse(temperatureCelsius);

            // Convert Celsius to Fahrenheit.
            double fahrenheit = (celsius * 9 / 5) + 32;

            return fahrenheit;
        }

        public static double FahrenheitToCelsius(string temperatureFahrenheit)
        {
            // Convert argument to double for calculations.
            double fahrenheit = Double.Parse(temperatureFahrenheit);

            // Convert Fahrenheit to Celsius.
            double celsius = (fahrenheit - 32) * 5 / 9;

            return celsius;
        }
    }
    class TestTemperatureConverter
    {
        static void Main()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Please select the convertor direction");
            Console.WriteLine("1. From Celsius to Fahrenheit.");
            Console.WriteLine("2. From Fahrenheit to Celsius.");
            Console.Write(":");

            string selection = Console.ReadLine();
            double F, C = 0;

            switch (selection)
            {
                case "1":
                    Console.Write("Please enter the Celsius temperature: ");
                    F = TemperatureConverter.CelsiusToFahrenheit(Console.ReadLine());
                    Console.WriteLine("Temperature in Fahrenheit: {0:F2}", F);
                    break;

                case "2":
                    Console.Write("Please enter the Fahrenheit temperature: ");
                    C = TemperatureConverter.FahrenheitToCelsius(Console.ReadLine());
                    Console.WriteLine("Temperature in Celsius: {0:F2}", C);
                    break;

                default:
                    Console.WriteLine("Please select a convertor.");
                    break;
            }

            // Keep the console window open in debug mode.
            Console.WriteLine("Press any key to exit.");
            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }

```

## **Const and Read-Only in C# with Examples**

```C#
using System;
namespace ConstDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        //we need to assign a value to the const variable
        //at the time of const variable declaration else it will
        //give compile time error
        const float PI = 3.14f; //Constant Variable
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            //Const variables are static in nature
            //so we can access them by using class name 
            Console.WriteLine(Program.PI);
            //We can also access them directly within the same class
            Console.WriteLine(PI);

            //We can also declare a constant variable within a function
            const int Number = 10;
            Console.WriteLine(Number);

            //Once after declaration we cannot change the value 
            //of a constant variable. So, the below line gives an error
            //Number = 20;

            Console.ReadLine();
        }
    }
}

```

```C#
using System;
namespace ConstDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        public const float PI = 3.14f; //Constant Variable
        int Age = 10; //Non-Static Variable
        static string Message = "Good Morning"; //Static Variable
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
        }
    }
}

```

##### **Read-Only Variables in C#**

When we declare a variable by using the readonly keyword, then it is known as a read-only variable and these variables can’t be modified like constants but after initialization. That means it is not mandatory to initialize a read-only variable at the time of its declaration, they can also be initialized under the constructor. That means we can modify the read-only variable value only within a constructor.

```C#
using System;
namespace TypesOfVariables
{
    internal class Program
    {
        readonly int x; //Readonly Variable
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Program obj1 = new Program();
            //Accessing Readonly variable using instance
            Console.WriteLine($"{obj1.x}");
            Console.Read();
        }
    }
}

```

##### **Read-only Variable Initialization through Constructor in C#**

```C#
using System;
namespace ReadOnlyDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        readonly int number = 5;

        //You can also initialize through constructor
        public Program()
        {
            number = 20;
        }
        
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Program obj = new Program();
            Console.WriteLine(obj.number);

            //You cannot change the value of a readonly variable once it is initialized
            //The following statement will give us compile time error 
            //obj.number = 20;

            Console.ReadLine();
        }
    }
}

```

##### **Const, Readonly, Static and Non-Static Variables**

```c#
using System;
namespace ConstReadOnlyStaticNonStaticDemo
{
    internal class Program
    {
        const float PI = 3.14f; //Constant Variable
        static int x = 100; //Static Variable
        //We are going to initialize variable y and z through constructor
        int y; //Non-Static or Instance Variable
        readonly int z; //Readonly Variable

        //Constructor
        public Program(int a, int b)
        {
            //Initializing non-static variable
            y = a;
            //Initializing Readonly variable
            z = b;
        }

        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            //Accessing the static variable without instance
            Console.WriteLine($"x value: {x}");
            //Accessing the constant variable without instance
            Console.WriteLine($"PI value: {PI}");

            //Creating two instances
            Program obj1 = new Program(300, 45);
            Program obj2 = new Program(400, 55);
            //Accessing Non-Static and Readonly variables using instance
            Console.WriteLine($"obj1 y value: {obj1.y} and Readonly z value: {obj1.z}");
            Console.WriteLine($"obj2 y value: {obj2.y} and Readonly z value: {obj2.z}");
            Console.Read();
        }
    }
}

```
