The Object class is the Superclass of all dot net types. That means, all the types in .NET Framework are inherited directly or indirectly from the Object class. Because of this inheritance, every type in .NET inherits the ToString() method from the Object class. If you go to the definition of Object class, then you will see that the ToString() method is defined as a Virtual Method which allows this method to be overridden in the child classes. Not only the ToString method but also you can override the Equals method which we will discuss in our next article.

![[Object-Class-in-C.webp]]

**Note:** Every type in .NET is implicitly inherited from the Object class and hence all the public and protected members of the object class (excluding private members) are inherited into the child class and by using the child class object we can access all the public and protected members of the object class in C#. For example, int is a primitive type and string a reference type and both of these two types are inherited from the Object class, and hence using the variable of int and string type, we can access all the public and protected members of the object class.

In other words, we can say that each and every class type (Reference Types) or struct type (Value Types) are directly or indirectly implicitly inherited from the Object class in C#. Therefore, every object in C# gets the ToString method, which returns a string representation of that object. So, the ToString() method returns a string that represents the current object.


```C#
using System;
namespace UnderstandingObjectClassMethods
{
    public class Program
    {
        public static void Main()
        {
            int Number = 100;
            Console.WriteLine(Number.ToString());
        }
    }
}
```

```C#
using System;

namespace UnderstandingObjectClassMethods
{
    public class Program
    {
        public static void Main()
        {
            Employee emp = new Employee();
            emp.FirstName = "Pranaya";
            emp.LastName = "Rout";
            Console.WriteLine(emp.ToString());
            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }

    public class Employee
    {
        public string FirstName;
        public string LastName;
    }
}
```

When you run the above code it will give you the below output. It is giving us the fully qualified name of the Employee type.


##### **Overriding the ToString() Method in C#:**
```C#
using System;
namespace UnderstandingObjectClassMethods
{
    public class Program
    {
        public static void Main()
        {
            Employee emp = new Employee();
            emp.FirstName = "Pranaya";
            emp.LastName = "Rout";
            Console.WriteLine(emp.ToString());
            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }

    public class Employee
    {
        public string FirstName;
        public string LastName;
        //Overriding the Virtual ToString method of Object class
        //Overriding the Virtual method using override modifier
        public override string ToString()
        {
            return FirstName + ", " + LastName;
        }
    }
}

```

## **Override Equals Method **

![[word-image-27425-1-7.webp]]


```C#
using System;
namespace UnderstandingEqualsMethod
{
    public class Program
    {
        public static void Main()
        {
            int Number1 = 10;
            int Number2 = 10;
            Console.WriteLine($"Number1 == Number2: {Number1 == Number2}");
            Console.WriteLine($"Number1.Equals(Number2): {Number1.Equals(Number2)}");
            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}

```
![[word-image-27425-3-9.webp]]

```C#
using System;
namespace UnderstandingEqualsMethod
{
    public class Program
    {
        public static void Main()
        {
            Direction direction1 = Direction.East;
            Direction direction2 = Direction.East;
            Console.WriteLine(direction1 == direction2);
            Console.WriteLine(direction1.Equals(direction2));
            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
    public enum Direction
    {
        East = 1,
        West = 2,
        North = 3,
        South = 4
    }
}

```

##### **Equals method and == Operator** **with Reference Type in C#:**

If the type is a reference type, then by default both the == operator and Equals method check for reference equality whereas we can change this default behavior of the Equals() method by overriding it to check for value equality. If this is not clear at the moment, don’t worry let us understand this with an example,

In the following example, C1 and C2 are 2 different object reference variables of the Customer class. But both are pointing to the same object. The most important point that you need to keep in mind is reference variables are different from objects. Reference variables are created on the stack memory and they point to the actual objects which are stored in the heap memory.

Since, C1 and C2 both refer to the same object, the reference equality, and the value equality is true. Value equality means that two objects contain the same values. In this example, the actual object is only one, so obviously, the values are also equal. If two objects have reference equality, then they also have value equality, but value equality does not guarantee reference equality.


```C#
using System;
namespace UnderstandingEqualsMethod
{
    public class Program
    {
        public static void Main()
        {
            Customer C1 = new Customer();
            C1.FirstName = "Pranaya";
            C1.LastName = "Rout";

            Customer C2 = C1;

            Console.WriteLine($"C1 == C2: {C1 == C2}");
            Console.WriteLine($"C1.Equals(C2): {C1.Equals(C2)}");

            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
    public class Customer
    {
        public string FirstName { get; set; }
        public string LastName { get; set; }
    }
}

```

![[word-image-27425-6-10.webp]]

In the following example, the **==** operator returns **False**. This makes sense because C1 and C2 are referring to different objects. However, the **Equals()** method also returns false, in spite of the values across C1 and C2 being the same and this is because by default Equals method checks the reference equality.

```c#
using System;
namespace UnderstandingEqualsMethod
{
    public class Program
    {
        public static void Main()
        {
            Customer C1 = new Customer();
            C1.FirstName = "Pranaya";
            C1.LastName = "Rout";

            Customer C2 = new Customer();
            C2.FirstName = "Pranaya";
            C2.LastName = "Rout";

            Console.WriteLine($"C1 == C2: {C1 == C2}");
            Console.WriteLine($"C1.Equals(C2): {C1.Equals(C2)}");

            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
    public class Customer
    {
        public string FirstName { get; set; }
        public string LastName { get; set; }
    }
}

```

In this case, we have created two Customer objects inside the Heap Memory and in Stack memory, we have two customer reference variables and both are pointing to different customer objects. As both C1 and C2 hold different customer object references and hence, both == operator and Equals methods check the references and find it to be FALSE.
![[word-image-27425-8-9.webp]]

##### **Overriding the Equals Method of the Object Class in C#:**

In the following example, we override the Equals() method of the Object class inside the Customer class. When overriding the **Equals()** method, make sure the passed object is not null and can be cast to the type you are comparing. When overriding **Equals()**, you also need to override GetHashCode(), otherwise you will get a compiler warning.
```C#
using System;
namespace UnderstandingEqualsMethod
{
    public class Program
    {
        public static void Main()
        {
            Customer C1 = new Customer();
            C1.FirstName = "Pranaya";
            C1.LastName = "Rout";

            Customer C2 = new Customer();
            C2.FirstName = "Pranaya";
            C2.LastName = "Rout";

            Console.WriteLine($"C1 == C2: {C1 == C2}");
            Console.WriteLine($"C1.Equals(C2): {C1.Equals(C2)}");

            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
    public class Customer
    {
        public string FirstName { get; set; }
        public string LastName { get; set; }

        public override bool Equals(object obj)
        {
            // If the passed object is null, return False
            if (obj == null)
            {
                return false;
            }
            // If the passed object is not Customer Type, return False
            if (!(obj is Customer))
            {
                return false;
            }
            return (this.FirstName == ((Customer)obj).FirstName)
                && (this.LastName == ((Customer)obj).LastName);
        }
    }
}

```

```C#
using System;
namespace UnderstandingObjectClassMethods
{
    public class Program
    {
        public static void Main()
        {
            Customer C1 = new Customer();
            C1.FirstName = "Pranaya";
            C1.LastName = "Rout";

            Customer C2 = new Customer();
            C2.FirstName = "Pranaya";
            C2.LastName = "Rout";

            var hashcode1 = C1.GetHashCode();
            var hashcode2 = C2.GetHashCode();

            Console.WriteLine($"C1.GetHashCode == C2.GetHashCode:{hashcode1 == hashcode2}");
            Console.WriteLine($"C1 == C2:{C1 == C2}");
            Console.WriteLine($"C1.Equals(C2):{C1.Equals(C2)}");

            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
    public class Customer
    {
        public string FirstName { get; set; }
        public string LastName { get; set; }

        public override bool Equals(object obj)
        {
            // If the passed object is null
            if (obj == null)
            {
                return false;
            }
            if (!(obj is Customer))
            {
                return false;
            }
            return (this.FirstName == ((Customer)obj).FirstName)
                && (this.LastName == ((Customer)obj).LastName);
        }

        //Overriding the GetHashCode method
        //GetHashCode method generates hashcode for the current object
        public override int GetHashCode()
        {
            //Performing BIT wise OR Operation on the generated hashcode values
            //If the corresponding bits are different, it gives 1.
            //If the corresponding bits are the same, it gives 0.
            return FirstName.GetHashCode() ^ LastName.GetHashCode();
        }
    }
}

## **Checked and Unchecked Keywords in C#**


ccording to MSDN, The **Checked Keyword in C#** is used to explicitly enable overflow checking for integral-type arithmetic operations and conversions. The **Unchecked Keyword in C#** is used to suppress overflow-checking for integral-type arithmetic operations and conversions.

Here, overflow checking means when the value of any integral type exceeds its range, it does not raise any exception, instead it will give us unexpected or garbage results. If this is not clear at the moment, then don’t worry we will try to understand the above two points with examples. 

##### **Example to Understand Checked Keyword in C#**

```c#
using System;
namespace CheckedUncheckedDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            int a = 2147483647;
            int b= 2147483647;

            int c = checked(a + b);

            Console.WriteLine(c);
            Console.ReadLine();
        }
    }
}
```

Now, when you run the application, you should get the following OverflowException as expected.
![[word-image-52 1.webp]]

##### **Unchecked keyword in C#:**

Let us understand the need and use of unchecked keyword in C#. The unchecked keyword behaves almost the same way as the default behavior of the compiler.

Let’s prove the above point. So, modify the Program class as shown below and then see the output.

```C#
using System;
namespace CheckedUncheckedDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            int a = 2147483647;
            int b= 2147483647;

            int c = unchecked(a + b);

            Console.WriteLine(c);
            Console.ReadLine();
        }
    }
}
```
As shown in the above code, we have just added the unchecked keyword in front of the arithmetic expression of the c variable. Now, run your application and you should get the following output..

```C#
using System;
namespace CheckedUncheckedDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            const int a = 2147483647;
            const int b= 2147483647;

            int c = unchecked(a + b);

            Console.WriteLine(c);
            Console.ReadLine();
        }
    }
}
```


## **Stack and Heap Memory in .NET with Examples**

##### **What Happens Internally When We Declare a Variable in a .NET Application?**

When we declare a variable in a .NET application, it allocates some memory in the RAM. The memory that it allocates in RAM has three things are as follows:

1. **Name of the Variable,**
2. **The Data Type of the Variable, and**
3. **Value of the Variable.**

we declare a variable of type int and assign a value 101.
![[word-image-55.webp]]
he above image shows a high-level overview of what is happening in the memory. But depending on the data type (i.e., depending on the value type and reference type ), the memory may be allocated either in the stack or in the heap memory.

##### **Understanding Stack and Heap Memory in C#:**

There are two types of memory allocation for the variables we created in the .NET Application, i.e., Stack Memory and Heap Memory. Let us understand the Stack and Heap Memory with an Example. To understand Stack and Heap Memory, please have a look at the following code, and let’s understand what actually happens in the below code internally.

![[DotNet/CShapr/images/word-image-56.webp]]

As you can see in the above image, the SomeMethod has three statements. Let’s understand statement by statement how things are executed internally.

##### **Statement 1:**

When the first statement is executed, the compiler allocates some memory in the stack. The stack memory is responsible for keeping track of the running memory needed in your application. For a better understanding, please have a look at the following image.

![[DotNet/CShapr/images/word-image-57.webp]]

##### **Statement 2:**

When the second statement is executed, it stacks this memory allocation (memory allocation for variable y) on top of the first memory allocation (memory allocation for variable x). You can think about the stack as a series of plates or dishes put on top of each other. Please have a look at the following diagram for a better understanding.
![[DotNet/CShapr/images/word-image-58.webp]]

##### **Statement3:**

In the 3rd statement, we have created an object of SomeClass. When the 3rd statement is executed, it internally creates a pointer on the stack memory, and the actual object is stored in a different memory location called Heap memory. The Heap Memory location does not track running memory. Heap is used for dynamic memory allocation. For a better understanding, please have a look at the below image.

![[DotNet/CShapr/images/word-image-59.webp]]

**Note:** The reference pointers are allocated on the stack. The statement, **SomeClass cls1,** does not allocate any memory for an instance of **SomeClass.** It only allocates a variable with the name cls1 in the stack and sets its value to null. When it hits the new keyword, it allocates memory in the heap.

##### **What Happens When the Method Completes Its Execution?**

When the three statements are executed, the control will exit from the method. When it passes the end control, i.e., the end curly brace “},” it will clear all the memory variables created on the stack. It will de-allocate the memory from the stack in a ‘LIFO’ fashion. For a better understanding, please have a look at the below image.

![[word-image-60 1.webp]]

It will not de-allocate the Heap memory. Later, the heap memory will be de-allocated by the garbage collector. Now, you may have one question in your mind: why two types of memory? Can’t we allocate everything to just one memory type?

##### **Why do we have two types of memory?**

In C#, primitive data types, such as int, double, bool, etc., hold a single value. On the other hand, the reference data types or object data types are complex, i.e., an object data type or reference data type can have reference to other objects and other primitive data types.

So, the reference data type holds references to other multiple values, and each one of them must be stored in memory. Object types need dynamic memory, while primitive data types need static memory. Please have a look at the following image for a better understanding.
![[DotNet/CShapr/images/word-image-61.webp]]

##### **Value Types and Reference Types in C#.NET**

As we understood the concept of Stack and Heap, Now, let us move forward and understand the concept value types and reference types in C#. The Value types are the types that hold both data and memory in the same location. On the other hand, a reference type is a type that has a pointer that points to the actual memory location.

##### **Understanding Value Type in C#:**

Let us understand value type with an example. Please have a look at the following image. As you can see in the image, first, we create an integer variable with the name x, and then we assign this x integer value to another integer variable named y. In this case, the memory allocation for these two variables will be done inside the stack memory.

![[word-image-62 1.webp]]

##### **Understanding Reference Type in C#:**

Let us understand reference type with an example. Please have a look at the following image. Here, first, we create an object, i.e., obj1) and then assign this object to another object, i.e., obj2. In this case, both reference variables (obj1 and obj2) will point to the same memory location.
![[word-image-63 1.webp]]

In this case, when you change one of them, the other object is also affected. These kinds of data types are termed Reference types in .NET. So, class, interface, object, string, and delegate are examples of Reference Types.

##### **How is the Heap Memory Freed Up?**

The memory allocation on the stack is deallocated when the control moves out from the method, i.e., once the method completes its execution. On the other hand, the memory allocation, which is done on the heap, needs to be de-allocated by the garbage collector.

When an object stored on the heap is no longer used, that means the object does not have any reference pointing. Then, the object is eligible for garbage collection. The garbage collector will de-allocate this object from the heap at some point.

##### **Stack Memory Key Points:**

- **Allocation:** Stack memory is allocated for static memory allocation and local variables. It’s managed by the CPU, making it faster and more efficient.
- **Usage:** When a method is called, a block of memory (a stack frame) is allocated on the stack for its local variables and parameters. When the method call returns, the block becomes unused and can be used for the next method call.
- **Lifespan:** Variables stored in the stack are only available during the lifetime of the method call.
- **Type of Data:** It stores value types in C#. These include primitive data types (like int, double, char), structs, and references to objects (the references themselves, not the objects).

##### **Heap Memory Key Points:**

- **Allocation:** Heap memory is used for dynamic memory allocation, which includes objects and complex data structures that require more flexibility and are managed by the garbage collector in .NET.
- **Usage:** Objects are allocated on the heap, and memory is managed at runtime. New objects are created using the new keyword, and the garbage collector automatically frees up heap memory when objects are no longer in use.
- **Lifespan:** Objects on the heap live from when they are created until they are no longer used and are garbage collected.
- **Type of Data:** It stores reference types like objects, arrays, and class instances.

##### **Key Differences Between Stack and Head Memory in .NET:**

- **Management:** Stack memory is automatically managed by the system, whereas heap memory is dynamically allocated and deallocated by the garbage collector.
- **Speed:** Stack memory is generally faster than heap memory because of its organization and the way it’s managed.
- **Size:** The stack has size limits based on the thread, but the heap can dynamically grow as needed (limited by the system’s available memory).
- **Access:** Stack memory access is more straightforward and faster, while heap memory requires more complex management.
- **Storage:** Value types are stored in stack memory, while reference types are stored in heap memory.
