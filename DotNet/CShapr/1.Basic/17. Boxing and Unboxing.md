 Boxing and Unboxing are two fundamental concepts in C# that deal with converting between value and reference types. Understanding these concepts is crucial because they affect performance and memory usage.

##### **Boxing and Unboxing in C#:**

**Boxing:** Boxing is the process of converting a value type (like int, double, struct) to a reference type (object). When a value type is boxed, a new object is allocated to the heap, and the value is copied into it.

**Unboxing:** Unboxing is the reverse process of boxing, where a value is extracted from an object. It involves explicitly converting a reference type (object) into a value type. This operation also involves a copy operation, where the value is copied from the heap into the stack.

Let us understand Boxing and Unboxing in C# with an example. Please have a look at the following code.

The above method contains three lines of code. Now, let us understand what happens when executing each code line.

##### **Line1: int x = 10;**

When this statement is executed, an integer variable x will be created in the Stack memory with a value of 10. For a better understanding, please have a look at the following diagram.
![[word-image-28175-2.webp]]

##### **Line2: object y = x;**

When executing this statement, we move the x value, i.e., 10, to an object data type. If you remember, the object is the parent class for all classes in the .NET Framework. When we move a value type to a reference type, it is called Boxing. So, here we are moving value type integer x to reference type object y, so we are performing boxing here.

So, when we move a value type to a reference type or set a value type to a reference type, it is called Boxing in C#.

##### **Line3: int z = (int)y;**

When executing this statement, we move the object value to an integer data type by doing type casting. When we move a reference type to a value type, it is called Unboxing. So, we are moving the reference type value, i.e., y, to an integer type, i.e., z, so we are performing Unboxing here.

So, when we move a reference type to a value type or set it to a value type, it is called Unboxing in C#.

**Note:** Boxing means you set a value type to a reference type, and unboxing means you set a reference type to a value type.

##### **Example to Understand Boxing and Unboxing in C#:**

Now, we will create a simple example implementing the Boxing and Unboxing using C# Language, and then we will see how the IL code looks like. So, create a console application and then modify the Program class as follows:

```c#
namespace BoxingUnboxingDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            int x = 10;
            object y = x; //Boxing
            int z = (int)y; //Unboxing
        }
    }
}

```

##### **Performance Implication of Boxing in C#:**

Let us first see the performance implication of Boxing in C#. Please have a look at the following example. In the below example, we have created two methods, i.e., Boxing and WithoutBoxing. In the Boxing method, we are performing boxing, i.e., moving a value type to a reference type, and in the WithoutBoxing method, we are not performing either boxing or unboxing, i.e., we are performing a simple assignment. Then, from the Main method, we are calling both Methods using two different for loops. And both the loop is going to execute **1000000** times. Further, to measure the time, we are using StopWatch.


```C#
using System;
using System.Diagnostics;
namespace BoxingUnboxingDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Stopwatch stopwatch1 = new Stopwatch();
            stopwatch1.Start();
            for(int i = 1; i<= 1000000; i++)
            {
                Boxing();
            }
            
            stopwatch1.Stop();
            Console.WriteLine($"Boxing took: {stopwatch1.ElapsedMilliseconds} MS");

            Stopwatch stopwatch2 = new Stopwatch();
            stopwatch2.Start();
            for (int i = 1; i <= 1000000; i++)
            {
                WithoutBoxing();
            }
            stopwatch2.Stop();
            Console.WriteLine($"Without Boxing took: {stopwatch2.ElapsedMilliseconds} MS");
            Console.ReadKey();
        }

        //With Boxing
        public static void Boxing()
        {
            int i = 100;
            object j = i; //Boxing
        }

        //Without Boxing
        public static void WithoutBoxing()
        {
            int i = 100;
            int j = i; //No Boxing and No Unboxing
        }
    }
}

```

##### **Performance Implication of Unboxing in C#:**

```C#
using System;
using System.Diagnostics;
namespace BoxingUnboxingDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Stopwatch stopwatch1 = new Stopwatch();
            stopwatch1.Start();
            for(int i = 1; i<= 1000000; i++)
            {
                Unboxing();
            }
            
            stopwatch1.Stop();
            Console.WriteLine($"Unboxing took: {stopwatch1.ElapsedMilliseconds} MS");

            Stopwatch stopwatch2 = new Stopwatch();
            stopwatch2.Start();
            for (int i = 1; i <= 1000000; i++)
            {
                WithoutBoxingAndUnboxing();
            }
            stopwatch2.Stop();
            Console.WriteLine($"WithoutBoxingAndUnboxing took: {stopwatch2.ElapsedMilliseconds} MS");
            Console.ReadKey();
        }

        //With Unboxing
        public static void Unboxing()
        {
            object j = 100;
            int i = (int) j; //Unboxing
        }

        //Without Boxing
        public static void WithoutBoxingAndUnboxing()
        {
            int i = 100;
            int j = i; //No Boxing and No Unboxing
        }
    }
}

```
