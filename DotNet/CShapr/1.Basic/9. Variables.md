Why we are executing a program means to process the information or data. For example, a bank application. They are executing one program or one transaction. While executing the transaction, what they are actually doing is, they are processing the data like processing the account number, account name, balance, etc.

Whenever we are processing the data or information, the data or information must be at some location. And we call that location a Memory Location. Every computer has memory locations, and every memory location is identified by an address. Just consider in a movie hall, the seating arrangement as memory locations.

So, every memory location in the computer is identified by an address. For a better understanding, please have a look at the below image. As you can see in the below image, 128, 572, 1024, 5098, etc. are one-one memory addresses. We can treat all the addresses are positive integer values.

##### **What is the relation between variable and memory locations?**

Suppose I want to store a value of 10 in the computer memory locations. Just consider a classroom, there is no restriction on the students where they can sit. That means the students will go and sit randomly at different locations. In the same way, the value 10 that we want to store in the computer memory locations will also go and be stored randomly at a particular memory location. For a better understanding, please have a look at the below image.

![[what-is-the-relation-between-variable-and-memory-l.webp]]

##### **How we can set Identity to Memory Locations?**

We can set the identity of the memory location by using variables or you can say identifiers. The following is the syntax to declare a variable by setting the identity of the memory location in the C# language. First, we need to write the data type followed by the identifier.

**Syntax: data_type Identifier;**

**Example: int a;** //Here int is the data type and the identifier can be any name and here we set it as a. So, whenever we declare a variable, it gets memory allocated. To one memory location, the identity is set as shown in the below image.

##### **How to declare a variable in C#?**

The Syntax for declaring a variable in C# is as follows:  
**Syntax: data_type variable_name;**  
Here, data_type is the type of data to be stored in the variable, and variable_name is the name given to that variable.

**Example: int age;**  
Here, the data type is int and age is the name of the variable where the age variable can only hold an integer value.


##### **How to initialize a Variable in C#?**

The Syntax for initializing a variable in C# is as follows:  
**Syntax: data_type variable_name = value;**  
Here, data_type is the type of data to be stored in the variable, variable_name is the name given to the variable and value is the initial value stored in the variable.

**Example: int age = 20;**  
Here, int is the data type and age is the name of the variable where 20 is the integer value stored inside the age variable.


##### **Types of Variables in a Class in C#:**

Now, let us understand the different kinds of variables a class can have and their behavior. Basically, there are four types of variables that we can declare inside a class in C#. They are as follows:

1. **Non-Static/Instance Variable**
2. **Static Variable**
3. **Constant Variable**
4. **Readonly Variable**

The behavior of all these different variables is going to vary. Let us understand each of these variables in C#.

##### **Static and Non-Static Variables in C#**

```C#
using System;
namespace TypesOfVariables
{
    internal class Program
    {
        static int x; //Static Variable
        int y; //Non-Static or Instance Variable
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            int z; //Static Variable

			static int xx = 100; //Static Variable

			int yy = 200; //Non-Static or Instance Variable
        }
    }
}

```

##### **When Static and Non-Static Variables are Initialized in C#?**

```C#
using System;
namespace TypesOfVariables
{
    internal class Program
    {
        static int x = 100; //Static Variable
        int y = 200; //Non-Static or Instance Variable
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"x value: {x}");
            Program obj1 = new Program();
            Program obj2 = new Program();
            Console.WriteLine($"obj1 y value: {obj1.y}");
            Console.WriteLine($"obj2 y value: {obj2.y}");
            Console.Read();
        }
    }
}

```

##### **Initializing Non-Static variables through Class Constructor in C#:**

```C
using System;
namespace TypesOfVariables
{
    internal class Program
    {
        static int x = 100; //Static Variable
        int y = 200; //Non-Static or Instance Variable

        //Class Constructor
        public Program(int a)
        {
            y = a;
            
        }

        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"x value: {x}");
            Program obj1 = new Program(300);
            Program obj2 = new Program(400);
            Console.WriteLine($"obj1 y value: {obj1.y}");
            Console.WriteLine($"obj2 y value: {obj2.y}");
            Console.Read();
        }
    }
}

```

```C#
using System;
namespace TypesOfVariables
{
    internal class Program
    {
        static int x = 100; //Static Variable
        int y = 200; //Non-Static or Instance Variable

        //Class Constructor
        public Program(int a)
        {
            y = a; //Initializing non-static variable
            x = a; //Initializing static variable
        }

        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"x value: {x}"); //x = 100

            Program obj1 = new Program(300);
            Console.WriteLine($"obj1 y value: {obj1.y}");
            Console.WriteLine($"x value: {x}"); //x = 300

            Program obj2 = new Program(400); 
            Console.WriteLine($"obj2 y value: {obj2.y}");
            Console.WriteLine($"x value: {x}"); //x = 400
            Console.Read();
        }
    }
}

```

##### **Constant Variables in C#:**

```c#
using System;
namespace TypesOfVariables
{
    internal class Program
    {
        const float PI = 3.14f; //Constant Variable
        static int x = 100; //Static Variable
        //We are going to initialize variable y through constructor
        int y; //Non-Static or Instance Variable

        //Constructor
        public Program(int a)
        {
            //Initializing non-static variable
            y = a; 
        }

        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            //Accessing the static variable without instance
            Console.WriteLine($"x value: {x}");
            //Accessing the constant variable without instance
            Console.WriteLine($"PI value: {PI}");

            Program obj1 = new Program(300);
            Program obj2 = new Program(400);
            //Accessing Non-Static variable using instance
            Console.WriteLine($"obj1 y value: {obj1.y}");
            Console.WriteLine($"obj2 y value: {obj2.y}");
            Console.Read();
        }
    }
}

```

##### **Difference Between Static and Constant Variable in C#:**

The only difference between a static and constant variable is that the static variables can be modified whereas the constant variables in C# can’t be modified once it is declared. For a better understanding, please have a look at the following example. In the below example, inside the Main method, we are trying the modify both static x and constant PI value.

```C#
using System;
namespace TypesOfVariables
{
    internal class Program
    {
        const float PI = 3.14f; //Constant Variable
        static int x = 100; //Static Variable
        int y; //Non-Static or Instance Variable

        //Constructor
        public Program(int a)
        {
            //Initializing non-static variable
            y = a;
        }

        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            //Accessing the static variable without instance
            Console.WriteLine($"x value: {x}");
            //Accessing the constant variable without instance
            Console.WriteLine($"PI value: {PI}");

            x = 700; //Modifying Static Variable
            PI = 3.15f; //Trying to Modify the Constant Variable, Error

            Program obj1 = new Program(300);
            Program obj2 = new Program(400);
            //Accessing Non-Static variable using instance
            Console.WriteLine($"obj1 y value: {obj1.y}");
            Console.WriteLine($"obj2 y value: {obj2.y}");
            Console.Read();
        }
    }
}

```

##### **Example to Understand Read-Only Variables in C#:**
In the below example, the read-only variable z is not initialized with any value but when we print the value of the variable, the default value of int i.e. 0 will be displayed.

```C#
using System;
namespace TypesOfVariables
{
    internal class Program
    {
        const float PI = 3.14f; //Constant Variable
        static int x = 100; //Static Variable
        //We are going to initialize variable y through constructor
        int y; //Non-Static or Instance Variable
        readonly int z; //Readonly Variable

        //Constructor
        public Program(int a)
        {
            //Initializing non-static variable
            y = a; 
        }

        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            //Accessing the static variable without instance
            Console.WriteLine($"x value: {x}");
            //Accessing the constant variable without instance
            Console.WriteLine($"PI value: {PI}");

            Program obj1 = new Program(300);
            Program obj2 = new Program(400);
            //Accessing Non-Static variable using instance
            Console.WriteLine($"obj1 y value: {obj1.y} and Readonly z value: {obj1.z}");
            Console.WriteLine($"obj2 y value: {obj2.y} and Readonly z value: {obj2.z}");
            Console.Read();
        }
    }
}

```

            //Accessing the constant variable without instance
            Console.WriteLine($"PI value: {PI}");

            Program obj1 = new Program(300, 45);
            Program obj2 = new Program(400, 55);
            //Accessing Non-Static variable using instance
            Console.WriteLine($"obj1 y value: {obj1.y} and Readonly z value: {obj1.z}");
            Console.WriteLine($"obj2 y value: {obj2.y} and Readonly z value: {obj2.z}");
            Console.Read();
        }
    }
}

##### **Difference Between Non-Static and Readonly in C#:**

```C#
using System;
namespace TypesOfVariables
{
    internal class Program
    {
        const float PI = 3.14f; //Constant Variable
        static int x = 100; //Static Variable
        //We are going to initialize variable y through constructor
        int y; //Non-Static or Instance Variable

        {
            //Initializing non-static variable
            y = a;
            //Initializing Readonly variable
            z = b;

            obj1.y = 500; //Modifying Non-Static Variable
            obj1.z = 400; //Trying to Modify Readonly Variable, Getting Error

            Console.Read();
        }
    }
}

```

##### **Local Variables in C#:**

The Local Variables in C# are declared inside the method of a class. The scope of the local variable is limited to the method, which means you cannot access it from outside the method. The initialization of the local variable is mandatory.

1. **Scope of the Local Variables:** Within the block in which it is declared.
2. **The lifetime of the Local Variable:** Until the control leaves the block in which it is declared.
```C#
using System;
namespace TypesOfVariables
{
    internal class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.Read();
        }

        public void NonStaticBlock()
        {
            //By Default, every local variable is going to be non-static
            //The Scope is limited to this method only
            int x = 100;
        }

        public static void StaticBlock()
        {
            //By Default, every local variable is going to be static
            //The Scope is limited to this method only
            int y = 100;
        }
    }
}


```
