##### **What are the Functions of C# Language?**

A function is a group of related instructions that performs a specific task. It can be a small or big task, but the function will perform that task completely. Functions take some input as parameters and return the result as a return value. If we write a function, then we can reuse the function multiple times in the program. That means functions allow us to reuse the code without retyping the code.

##### **Why do we need functions?**

Let us understand why we need functions with an example. Functions are also called modules or procedures. Instead of writing a single main program, i.e., everything inside the main function, we can break the main function into small manageable size pieces and separate the repeating tasks or smaller tasks as a function.

**For Example,** if we write one program and put everything inside the main function, then such a type of programming approach is called Monolithic Programming. If your main function contains thousands of lines of code, then it is becoming very difficult to manage. This is actually not a good programming approach.


![[functions-or-why-should-we-learn-functions.webp]]


##### **Problems in Monolithic Programming:**

1. **First problem:** if there is an error in a single line, it’s an error in the entire program or main function.
2. **Second problem:** 10000 lines of code we cannot finish in one hour or one day; it might take a few days, and we should remember everything throughout that time. Then only we can make changes or write new lines in the program. So, we should memorize the whole program.
3. **Third problem:** How many people can write this one single main function? Only one person can write. We cannot make it a teamwork and more than one person can’t work on the same main function. So, work cannot be distributed in a team.
4. **Fourth problem:** when this program becomes very big, it may fit in some computer memories, and it may not fit in some of the memories. It Depends on the size and the hardware contribution of the computer you are running.

##### **Types of Functions in C#:**

Basically, there are two types of Functions in C#. They are as follows:

1. Built-in Functions
2. User-Defined Functions

![[word-image-33.webp]]

**Note:** The function which is already defined in the framework and available to be used by the developer or programmer is called a built-in function, whereas if the function is defined by the developer or programmer explicitly, then it is called a user-defined function

##### **Example to understand Built-in C# Functions:**

```C#
using System;
namespace FunctionDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            int number = 25;
            double squareRoot = Math.Sqrt(number);
            Console.WriteLine($"Square Root of {number} is {squareRoot}");
            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}

```

##### **What are the limitations of Pre-Defined Functions in C# Language?**

All the predefined functions in C# are contained limited tasks only, i.e., for what purpose the function is designed for the same purpose it should be used. So, whenever a predefined function does not support our requirements, we need to go for user-defined functions.

##### **What are User-Defined Functions in C# Language?**

The User-defined functions in C# are the functions that are created by the programmer so that he/she can use them many times. It reduces the complexity of a big program and optimizes the code. C# allows you to define functions according to your need. The function whose body is implemented by the developer or user is called a user-defined function.

As per client or project requirements, the functions we are developing are called user-defined functions. Always user-defined functions are client-specific functions or project-specific functions only. As a programmer, we have full control of user-defined functions. As a programmer, it is possible to alter or modify any user-defined function’s behavior if required because the coding part is available.


##### **How to Create a User-Defined Function in C#?**

Let us see how to write a function in C#. First of all, the function should have a **name** **that is** **mandatory**. Then it should have a **parameter list** (the parameters it is taking) which is optional; then the function should have a **return type** **which is mandatory**. A function can have an access specifier, which is optional, and a modifier which is also optional. For a better understanding, please have a look at the below image.

![[How-to-write-a-function-in-C.webp]]

1. **Function Name:** It is mandatory, and it defines the name of the method or function. The method signature consists of the method name and parameter list. The Methods are identified by their name. The rules for giving function names are the same as the rules for giving variable names. Same rules you should follow for giving function names also.
2. **Parameter List:** It is Optional and defines the list of parameters. A function that can take 0 or more parameters may not take any input.
3. **Return Type:** It is Mandatory and defines the method’s return type value. A function may or may not return a value, but it can return at most one value. It cannot return multiple values but can take multiple values as parameters. If the function is not returning any value, then the return type should be void.
4. **Access Specifier:** It is Optional and defines the method’s scope. That means it defines the accessibility of the method, such as private, protected, public, etc.
5. **Modifier:** It is optional and defines the method’s access type. For example, static, virtual, partial, sealed, etc. If you declare the method with a static modifier, then you can access the method directly without creating an instance. If you declare the method with the sealed modifier, then this method is not going to be overridden under a child class. And if you declare the method with the partial modifier, then you can split the method definition into two parts.
6. **Function Body:** The function’s body defines the code or list of statements you need to execute the function call. It is enclosed within curly braces.

**Note:** Access Specifiers and Modifiers are not the same. Method and Function are both the same, so we can use the term Method and Function interchangeability.

![[example-to-create-user-defined-method-in-java.webp]]

In the above example,  
**public** is the access specifier  
**int** is the return type  
**max** is the Method Name  
**(int x, int y)** is the Parameters list  
And this method does not have any modifiers.
##### **What is Function Signature in C#?**

In C# programming language, a **Method Signature** is consisting of two things, i.e., the **Method** **Name** and the **Parameter List**. The return type is not considered to be a part of the method signature. Later we will discuss why the return type is not considered part of the method signature.

###### **Example to Understand Function Signature in C#:**
![[Function-Signature-in-C.webp]]

##### **Understand Functions in C# Language:**
Let us see how to create and call a method in C#. In the below example, we have implemented the logic to add two numbers and then print the result on the console window, and we have written the logic inside the main method only.

```C#
using System;
namespace FunctionDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            int x, y;
            x = 10;
            y = 15;
            int sum = x + y;
            Console.WriteLine($"Sum is {sum}");
            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}

```

As you can see in the above code, first, we declare two variables, x and y, and then we initialize these two variables with values 10 and 15, respectively. Then we add these two variables and store the result in another variable, i.e., sum, and finally print the sum value in the console, which is what you can see in the output. Let us see how to write the same Program using Function. For a better understanding, please have a look at the below image.

![[word-image-34.webp]]

##### **Complete Example Code is Given Below:**

```C#
using System;
namespace FunctionDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            int x, y;
            x = 10;
            y = 15;
            int sum = Add(x, y);
            Console.WriteLine($"Sum is {sum}");
            Console.ReadKey();
        }

        static int Add(int a, int b)
        {
            int sum = a + b;
            return sum;
        }
    }
}

```


##### **Different Parts of a Function in C#:**

```C#

```
![[word-image-35.webp]]
##### **What are the Parameters of a function?**

![[word-image-36.webp]]

##### **How does it work inside the Main memory?**

When the program starts, i.e., when the main method starts its execution, three variables (x, y, and sum) are declared inside the stack, that is, inside the activation area of the main function. Then the x and y are assigned with values 10 and 15, respectively. And then, the main method calls the Add method. Once the Add method is called, its own activation area is created inside the stack, and it will have its own variables, i.e., variables a, b, and sum are created inside this activation area. Then the value of x i.e. 10, and the value of y i.e. 15, passed to Add function, are copied to the variables a and b, respectively. Then the Add method adds the two numbers and the result is 25, which is stored in the variable sum, and that result, i.e., 25, is returned from the Add method. That result coming from the Add method is stored in the variable sum, and that will be printed in the console window. For a better understanding, please have a look at the following image.

## **User-Defined Functions in C# with Examples**

##### **Understand No Arguments Passed and No Return Value Function in C# Language:**

In the below example, the Sum() function does not take any parameters, or even it does not return a value. The return type of the function is void. Hence, no value is returned from the function.

```C#
using System;
namespace FunctionDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Sum();
            Console.ReadKey();
        }
        static void Sum()
        {
            int x = 10;
            int y = 20;
            int sum = x + y;
            Console.WriteLine($"Sum of {x} and {y} is {sum}");
        }
    }
}

```
##### **No Arguments Passed but Return a Value Function in C#:**

```C#
using System;
namespace FunctionDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            int Result=Sum();
            Console.WriteLine($"Sum is {Result}");
            Console.ReadKey();
        }
        static int Sum()
        {
            int x = 10;
            int y = 20;
            int sum = x + y;
            return sum;
        }
    }
}

```


##### **Argument Passed but no Return Value Function in C# Language:**
When a function has arguments, it receives data from the calling function but does not return any value. So, there is data transfer between the calling function to called function, but there is no data transfer from the called function to the calling function. The nature of data communication between the calling function and the called function with arguments but no return value.
##### **Example to Understand Argument Passed but no Return Value Function in C# Language:**
In the example below, we pass two values to the Sum function, but the Sum function does not return any value to the main function.


```C#
using System;
namespace FunctionDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            int x = 10, y = 20;
            Sum(x, y);
            Console.ReadKey();
        }
        static void Sum(int x, int y)
        {
            int sum = x + y;
            Console.WriteLine($"Sum is {sum}");
        }
    }
}

```

##### **Argument Passed and Return Value Function in C# Language:**
A self-contained and independent function should behave like a “black box” that receives an input and outputs a value. Such functions will have two-way data communication.

```C#
using System;
namespace FunctionDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            int x = 10, y = 20;
            int Result = Sum(x, y);
            Console.WriteLine($"Sum is {Result}");
            Console.ReadKey();
        }
        static int Sum(int x, int y)
        {
            int sum = x + y;
            return sum;
        }
    }
}

```

##### **What is Function Overloading in C#?**
In C#, we can write more than one function with the same name, but with a different argument or parameter list, and when we do so, it is called function overloading. Let us understand this with an example.
```C#
static void main(){ 
       int a = 10, b = 2, c;
       c = add(a, b);
}
```

This is our main function. Inside this function, we have declared 3 variables. Next, we store the result of the ‘add()’ function in the ‘c’ variable. The following is the add function.  
**static int add(int x, int y){**  
      **return x + y;**  
**}**


Here we haven’t declared any variable; return ‘x + y’. When we call the ‘add’ function inside the main function, then a will be copied in ‘x’, and ‘b’ will be copied in ‘y’, and it will add these two numbers, and the result will store in ‘c’. Now we want to write one more function here,  
**static int add(int x, int y, int z){**  
       **return x + y + z;**  
**}**


We have changed the main function as follows.  
static void main(){  
**int a = 10, b = 2, c, d;**  
       **c = add (a, b);**  
       **d = add (a, b, c);**  
**}**

```c#
using System;
namespace FunctionDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            int a = 10, b = 2, c, d;
            c = add(a, b);
            Console.WriteLine($"Sum of {a} and {b} is {c}");
            d = add(a, b, c);
            Console.WriteLine($"Sum of {a} and {b} and {c} is {d}");
            Console.ReadKey();
        }
        static int add(int x, int y)
        {
            return x + y;
        }
        static int add(int x, int y, int z)
        {
            return x + y + z;
        }

    }
}

```

##### **Advantages of Function Overloading in C#**

The benefit here is that we don’t have to think of new names every time. As both functions are for adding integers, so we don’t have to give different names. It is easy to write the programs, and you don’t have to remember too many function names. That is the benefit we are getting now. Let us declare one more add function, which returns the sum of two float numbers.

**static float add(float x, float y){**  
        **return x + y;**  
**}**

This function will return the float type value. Now we have two add functions that are taking the same number of parameters. Is it possible in C#? Yes, two functions can have the same name and the same number of parameters, but the data type of the parameters should be different. They cannot be the same.

So **int add (int x, int y)** and **float add (float x, float y)** are two different functions. In C#, two functions are said to be different if they have the same name but different parameters list.


##### **How Can Be the Parameters List Different?**

Either the data type of the parameter or the number of parameters. For a better understanding, please have a look at the below image.

![[how-the-parameters-list-can-be-different.webp]]

Above are the signatures of the different ‘add’ functions. Now let us check which is valid or which is invalid.

1. **int add(int, int)** is valid; it takes 2 ‘int’ type parameters and returns the ‘int’ value.
2. **float add(float, float)** is valid as it takes 2 ‘float’ parameters and returns the ‘float’ value. It takes the same number of parameters but different data types as compared to the first one.
3. **int add(int, int, int)** is valid as it takes 3 ‘int’ parameters and returns the ‘int’ value. It takes a different number of parameters but has the same data types as compared to the first one.
4. **float add(int, int)** is **invalid;** it is the same as the first function, which takes the same number of parameters and the same type of parameters. So, this is invalid. It doesn’t matter what type of data a function is returning. If two functions have the same number of parameters and of the same type, then this is invalid.

##### **Example to understand function overloading in C#**
```C#
using System;
namespace FunctionDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            int a = 10, b = 2, c, d;
            c = add(a, b);
            Console.WriteLine($"Sum of {a} and {b} is {c}");
            d = add(a, b, c);
            Console.WriteLine($"Sum of {a} and {b} and {c} is {d}");
            Console.WriteLine($"Sum of 10.5 and 25.6 is {add(10.5f, 25.6f)}");
            Console.ReadKey();
        }
        static int add(int x, int y)
        {
            return x + y;
        }
        static int add(int x, int y, int z)
        {
            return x + y + z;
        }
        static float add(float x, float y)
        {
            return x + y;
        }
    }
}

```




## **Call by Value and Call by Reference in C#**


##### **Call By Value in C#**

In .NET Framework, by default, all the objects are called by value, not called by reference. So, whether it is a Value Type (Primitive data types like int, char, double, etc.) or Reference Data Type (class, interface, delegate, string, etc.), they will be called by value by default. Let us understand Call by Value in C# with some examples. Consider the following Example. In the following example, I am using the value data type.


```C#
using System;
namespace FunctionsDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            int a = 15;
            int b = a;
            b = 30;
            Console.WriteLine(a);
            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}

```

If your answer is 15, then you are absolutely right because **int** is a value data type, and by default, it is passed by value, which means for the above code, the variable “a” has stored the value 15 in it. When we create the variable b and assign it a, the value of a is copied to b, and after that, if we change b, it will not affect a. This is because we have copied the value of a to b.

##### **Memory Representation of Call by Value in Value Types in C#:**
Let us assume that the memory reference of variable a is 1010, and it holds the value 15. And when we execute the statement **int b = a;** in this case, it will pass the value i,e, 15 to the variable b. This is called by value mechanism in C# with value or primitive data type.

![[word-image-27425-1-4-768x421.webp]]

 Here, we have created a method called UpdateValue that updates the value of an int variable b to 30.
```C#
using System;
namespace FunctionsDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            int a = 15;
            UpdateValue(a);
            Console.WriteLine(a);
            Console.ReadKey();
        }

        private static void UpdateValue(int b)
        {
            b = 30;
        }
    }
}

```

##### **Call by Value with Reference Types in C#**
I have created the following Employee class to understand Call by Value with Reference Types in C#. We already know that class is a reference data type.
```C#
public class Employee  
{  
    public int EmployeeID;  
    public string Name;  
}  

```

Now, please observe the following code. Here, we create an instance of the Employee class, i.e., Emp1, and set its two data members. Next, we assign it (Emp1 instance) to another instance of the Employee class, i.e., Emp2, and change the Name property, and then we print EmployeeID and Name on the Console to check what is printed:

```C#
using System;
namespace FunctionsDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Employee Emp1 = new Employee();
            Emp1.EmployeeID = 1001;
            Emp1.Name = "James";

            Employee Emp2 = Emp1;
            Emp1.Name = "Smith";
            Console.WriteLine($"Emp1 Name = {Emp1.Name}");
            Console.WriteLine($"Emp2 Name = {Emp2.Name}");
            Console.ReadKey();

        }
    }

    public class Employee
    {
        public int EmployeeID;
        public string Name;
    }
}

```

When we create an Instance of the Employee class, an object is created inside the heap memory, and memory is allocated to it. We are storing the reference of that memory location in the Emp1 reference variable, mostly in stack memory.

When we assign Emp1 to Emp2, the reference of the object memory location that Emp1 is holding is copied to Emp2. Now we have two copies of reference, but they both point to the same memory location. So, changing the Name property’s value will change the object’s value in memory, which we have references in Emp1 and Emp2. So, “Smith” will be printed on the console for both references. So, when you run the above code, you will get the following output.


##### **Memory Representation Call by Value with Reference Types in C#**

When we create the first instance of the Employee object, i.e., Emp1, then we need to understand what happens inside the memory. In heap memory, one object will be created, which will allocate the memory for EmployeeId and Name data members. Then, let’s assume that the object’s memory address is 101011, and then that memory reference will be stored inside the Emp1 reference variable. Again, assume that the memory address of the Emp1 reference variable is 111000. So, the point that you need to remember is now Emp1 is a reference variable whose address is 111000, and it holds the reference address 101011.

![[word-image-27425-3-5.webp]]

Now, let us understand when we assigned the Emp1 reference variable to the Emp2 reference variable, i.e., **Employee Emp2 = Emp1;** and what happens when we update the Name on the Emp1 reference variable, i.e., **Emp1.Name = “Smith”;** For a better understanding, please have a look at the following image. When **Employee Emp2 = Emp1;** statement is executed, what value Emp1 is holding that will be copied to the Emp2 reference variable, Emp1 is holding 101011, so that will be copied to Emp2 as well. This is called by value with a reference type. Because here, we are not copying the memory address of Emp1, which is 111000; instead, we are copying the value which is held by Emp1, i.e., 101011, which is nothing but the memory address of the Employee object, which is created inside the Heap Memory. That means both reference variables are now pointing to the same memory location. Now, when **Emp1.Name = “Smith”;** statement is executed, it will update the Name to Smith of the Employee object in the heap memory, and hence the changes will be reflected in the reference variables.
![[word-image-27425-4-7.webp]]

We can also get the same behavior using a method. For a better understanding, please have a look at the following example.

```c#
using System;
namespace FunctionsDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Employee Emp1 = new Employee();
            Emp1.EmployeeID = 1001;
            Emp1.Name = "James";

            UpdateName(Emp1);
            Console.WriteLine($"Emp1 Name = {Emp1.Name}");
            Console.ReadKey();
        }

        public static void UpdateName(Employee Emp2)
        {
            Emp2.Name = "Smith";
            Console.WriteLine($"Emp2 Name = {Emp2.Name}");
        }
    }

    public class Employee
    {
        public int EmployeeID;
        public string Name;
    }
}

Now, if you think that you will get a Null Reference Exception in the Main method in the WriteLine statement where you print the Name, then you are wrong. If you think that it will output James, then you are right, and you have understood that by default, reference is passed by value in C#, not by reference.

**What would happen if we set the Emp2 to null inside the UpdateName method as follows?**

```C# 
using System;
namespace FunctionsDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Employee Emp1 = new Employee();
            Emp1.EmployeeID = 1001;
            Emp1.Name = "James";

            UpdateName(Emp1);
            Console.WriteLine($"Emp1 Name = {Emp1.Name}");
            Console.ReadKey();
        }

        public static void UpdateName(Employee Emp2)
        {
            Emp2 = null;
        }
    }

    public class Employee
    {
        public int EmployeeID;
        public string Name;
    }
}
```
Now, if you think that you will get a Null Reference Exception in the Main method in the WriteLine statement where you print the Name, then you are wrong. If you think that it will output James, then you are right, and you have understood that by default, reference is passed by value in C#, not by reference.

As you can see in the above image, when we set **Emp2 = null;** then the Emp2 references are deleted. But still, the Emp1 reference to the Employee object exists. This is the Call by Value mechanism in C#. Now, I hope you understand the Call by Value Mechanism in C# using value and reference types with Examples. If we want to make Emp1 also null, when you set Emp2 as null, then you have to pass it to the method via reference, which is done in C# by using the ref Keyword, i.e., nothing but pass by reference in C#. Let us understand Call by Reference in detail.


##### **Call By Reference in C#**

Let us understand Call by Reference or Pass by Reference with both value types as well as with reference type in C# with examples. We need to prefix the parameter with the ref keyword for the call by reference. I am going to explain Call by Reference using the same examples we discussed in Call by Value so that it will be easier for you to understand the concept and the differences between them.

##### **Call by Reference with Value Types in C#**

We will use the same example, but this time, we will be calling by reference. So, what we need to do is, we need to prefix the variable with the ref keyword. Please have a look at the following example. Here, you can see, inside the UpdateValue method, instead of **int b**, we are now using **ref int b**. Here, we have added the ref keyword with the input parameter, meaning the argument must be passed by reference when we call this method.


```C#
using System;
namespace FunctionsDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            int a = 15;
            UpdateValue(ref a);
            Console.WriteLine(a);
            Console.ReadKey();
        }

        static void UpdateValue(ref int b)
        {
            b = 30;
        }
    }
}

```

Then we call the UpdateValue method, but we have to use the ref keyword before the argument name. This is Call by Reference in C# with Value Type. If you do not use the ref keyword, you will get a compile-time error.

##### **Call by Reference with Reference Types in C#**

Now, we will see the same thing with a reference type. The behavior is going to be the same for reference types as well. We are also going to work with the same example that we worked with Call by Value with Reference Type. So, please have a look at the following example. Now, in the UpdateName method, we have added the ref keyword. In the main method, while calling the UpdateName method, we also prefixed the variable Emp1 with the ref keyword as follows:

```C#
using System;
namespace FunctionsDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Employee Emp1 = new Employee();
            Emp1.EmployeeID = 1001;
            Emp1.Name = "James";

            UpdateName(ref Emp1);
            Console.WriteLine($"Emp1 Name = {Emp1.Name}");
            Console.ReadKey();
        }

        public static void UpdateName(ref Employee Emp2)
        {
            Emp2 = null;
        }
    }
    public class Employee
    {
        public int EmployeeID;
        public string Name;
    }
}

```

Now, when the UpdateName method sets the Emp2 to null, this also sets the Emp1 to null. This is because of Call By Reference. So, in this case, the reference of Emp1 is passed to the method, and hence a new reference is not created for Emp2. So, when you run the above code, you will get a runtime error as shown in the below image. So, here, you can consider Emp2 as an alias of Emp1 or an alternative name for Emp1.

![[word-image-27425-7-6-1024x576.webp]]

To understand why we are getting the Null Reference Exception, we need to understand the memory representation of the above example. Let us assume the memory address of Emp1 is 111000, and it is pointing to the Employee object whose address is 101011. That means the Emp1 address is 111000, and it is holding the Employee Object reference address 101011. In the case of Call by Reference, when we pass ref Emp1, then, in that case, we are passing the memory address of Emp2, i.e., 111000. And on the computer, we cannot have the same memory address twice. So, here Emp2 is also pointing to the same memory address as Emp1. We can say that Emp2 is an alias of Emp1 or an alternative name of Emp1. So, when we make Emp2 null, that means the memory address 111000, which is pointing to the Employee object, i.e., 101011, will become null, and then we try to access the Name property, we get the runtime exception.

**Note:** If you want to achieve Call by Reference in C#, you must have to use either the out or ref keyword, regardless of whether the argument type is a value type or a reference type. In our upcoming article, we will discuss the need and use of ref and out keywords in detail.

##### **Difference between Call by Value and Call by Reference in C#:**

The most important point you need to remember is that in C#, all objects/values are called by value by default, not by reference, regardless of whether they’re Value Types or Reference Types. With this kept in mind, let us proceed and see the differences.

![[word-image-27425-9-4.webp]]

##### **Call By Value in C#:**

1. In Call by Value, the copy of the original variable is passed to the called function.
2. In Call by Value, the value of the original parameter is copied into the parameter of the function. As a result, if we make any modifications to formal parameters, they don’t have any impact on the actual parameter.
3. It will not allow you to change the actual variables using function calls.
4. The memory location referred to by formal parameters and actual arguments is different.
5. It doesn’t require a ref or out keyword in C#.

##### **Call By Reference in C#:**

1. In Call by Reference, the variable’s reference (or the actual address) is passed to the called function.
2. In Call by Reference, the formal and actual parameters point to the same memory address. As a result, any changes made to the formal parameters are also reflected in the actual parameters.
3. It allows you to change the actual variable’s value using function calls.
4. The memory location referred to by formal parameters and actual arguments are the same.
5. It requires a ref or out keyword to achieve Call By Reference in C#.
