##### **Object-Oriented Programming?**
OOP concepts using C#. Object-oriented programming (OOPs) in C# is a design approach where we think in terms of real-world objects rather than functions or methods. Unlike procedural programming language, in OOPs, programs are organized around objects and data rather than action and logic. Please have a look at the following diagram to understand this better.

OOPs provide 4 principles. They are

1. **Encapsulation**
2. **Inheritance**
3. **Polymorphism**
4. **Abstraction**

**Note:** Don’t consider Class and Objects as OOPs principle. We use classes and objects to implement OOP Principles.

Let’s understand the definitions of the OOPs Principle in this session. From the next article onwards, we will discuss all these principles in detail using some real-time examples.


##### **What are Abstraction and Encapsulation?**

The process of representing the essential features without including the background details is called [**Abstraction**](https://dotnettutorials.net/lesson/abstraction-csharp-realtime-example/). In simple words, we can say that it is a process of defining a class by providing necessary details to the external world, which are required by hiding or removing unnecessary things.

The process of binding the data and functions together into a single unit (i.e., class) is called [**Encapsulation**](https://dotnettutorials.net/lesson/encapsulation-csharp/). In simple words, we can say that it is a process of defining a class by hiding its internal data members from outside the class and accessing those internal data members only through publicly exposed methods or properties. Data encapsulation is also called data hiding because, using this principle, we can hide the internal data from outside the class.

Abstraction and Encapsulation are related to each other. We can say that Abstraction is logical thinking, whereas Encapsulation is its physical implementation.

##### **Understanding Abstraction and Encapsulation with an Example:**

Suppose you want to design one class for providing the register functionality of a user. For that, what you need to do is first you need to get the data and validate the data, then you need to get the connection string for the database, and finally, you need to save the data in the database. And for this, you have three methods, i.e., Validate, GetConnectionString, and SaveUser. If you provide access to these three methods to the users of this class, then he may end up calling these methods in the wrong order, or it may be possible that he may forget to call any of these methods.

So, here, you need to create one method called Register, and as part of that method, you need to call all these methods (Validate, GetConnectionString, and SaveUser) in a proper sequence. Finally, you need to give access to the Register method instead of the Validate, GetConnectionString, and SaveUser methods. This is what we discussed is nothing but abstraction. How you implement this is nothing but encapsulation. So, here, you need to create the Validate, GetConnectionString, and SaveUser methods with a private access specifier so the user cannot access these methods. Make the Register method Public so the user can access this method, as shown below.

We can achieve code **Simplicity** through Encapsulation and Abstraction.

##### **What is Inheritance?**

The process by which the members of one class are transferred to another class is called [**inheritance**](https://dotnettutorials.net/lesson/inheritance-c-sharp/). The class from which the members are transferred is called the Parent/Base/Superclass, and the class that inherits the Parent/Base/Superclass members is called the Derived/Child/Subclass. We can achieve code **extensibility** through inheritance.

##### **What is Polymorphism?**

[**Polymorphism**](https://dotnettutorials.net/lesson/polymorphism-csharp/) is derived from the Greek word, where Poly means many and morph means faces/ behaviors. So, the word polymorphism means the ability to take more than one form. Technically, we can say that the same function/operator will show different behaviors by taking different types of values or with a different number of values, called [**Polymorphism**](https://dotnettutorials.net/lesson/polymorphism-csharp/). There are two types of polymorphism.

1. Static polymorphism/compile-time polymorphism/Early binding
2. Dynamic polymorphism/Run time polymorphism/Late binding

Static polymorphism is achieved by **function overloading and operator overloading**, whereas dynamic polymorphism is achieved by **function overriding**.


##### **Why do we need Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) in C#?**

If you want to represent real-world objects in a programming language for automating the business by achieving **Reusability, Extensibility, Simplicity, and Maintainability**, then you need the concept of OOPs. OOPs provide some principles, and by using those principles, we can develop real-world objects in a programming language by achieving Reusability, Extensibility, Simplicity, and Maintainability.

All living and non-living things are considered objects. So real-world objects such as Persons, Animals, Bikes, Computers, etc., can be developed in object-oriented programming languages by using the OOPs concept.

##### **Why do we need real-world objects in a Project?**

We need real-world objects in a project because real-world objects are part of our business. As we are developing applications (software) for automating the business, we must create business-related real-world objects in the project.

For example, to automate the Bank business, we must create real-world objects like Customers, Managers, Clerks, Office Assistants, Marketing Executives, Computers, Printers, Chairs, tables, etc. So, along with the Bank object, we must also create all the above objects because, without all the above objects, we cannot run a Bank business. Technically, we call the above objects business objects.


##### **Advantages of OOP in C#:**

Here’s a summary of the key advantages and disadvantages of using OOP concepts in C#:

- **Modularity:** OOP promotes modular code by encapsulating data and behavior within classes. This makes managing and maintaining large codebases easier since you can work on individual classes independently.
- **Code Reusability:** Inheritance allows you to create new classes by reusing existing ones (base classes). This reduces code duplication and promotes a “write once, use many times” approach.
- **Abstraction:** OOP allows you to create abstract classes and interfaces that define a contract without providing implementation details. Abstraction simplifies complex systems by hiding unnecessary details.
- **Polymorphism:** Polymorphism enables you to write code that can work with objects of different classes through a common interface or base class. This flexibility simplifies code and allows for extensibility.
- **Encapsulation:** Encapsulation restricts access to the internal state of objects, promoting data integrity and security. You can control access to fields and methods using access modifiers like public, private, protected, and internal.
- **Maintenance and Debugging:** OOP’s modular and organized structure makes debugging and maintaining code easier. Changes in one class typically have limited impact on other parts of the code.
- **Scalability:** OOP principles can help create scalable and extensible software systems. New features can often be added by creating new classes and extending existing ones without modifying the existing code.
- **Readability:** OOP promotes code that is more human-readable and self-explanatory. Classes and objects map closely to real-world entities and interactions, making it easier for developers to understand the code’s purpose.
