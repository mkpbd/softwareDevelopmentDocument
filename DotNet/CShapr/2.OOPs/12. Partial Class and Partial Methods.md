##### **What is Partial Class in C#?**

Partial Class is the new feature that has been added in C# 2.0 which allows us to define a class on multiple files i.e. we can physically split the content of the class into different files but even physically they are divided but logically it is one single unit only. A class in which code can be written in two or more files is known as a partial class. To make any class partial we need to use the keyword partial.

According to Microsoft, It is possible to split the definition of a class over two or more source files. It is also possible to split the definition of a struct or an interface over two or more source files which we will discuss when we discuss the C# 8 new features. Each source file contains a section of the type i.e. class definition, and all parts are combined when the application is compiled.

##### **Understanding Partial Class in C# with an Example:**

Now, let us understand Partial Class with an example. First, create a console application and then add a class file with the name Employee.cs. Once you add the class file, then copy and paste the following code into it. Here, please notice the class name is Employee and in this class, we have declared 4 auto-implemented properties i.e. FirstName, LastName, Gender, and Salary. Here, we have also declared 2 public methods i.e. DisplayFullName and DisplayEmployeeDetails.


```C#
using System;
namespace PartialClassDemo
{
    public class Employee
    {
        public string FirstName { get; set; }
        public string LastName { get; set; }
        public string Gender { get; set; }
        public double Salary { get; set; }
        
        public void DisplayFullName()
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Full Name is : {FirstName} {LastName}");
        }

        public void DisplayEmployeeDetails()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Employee Details : ");
            Console.WriteLine($"First Name : {FirstName}");
            Console.WriteLine($"Last Name : {LastName}");
            Console.WriteLine($"Gender : {Gender}");
            Console.WriteLine($"Salary : {Salary}");
        }
    }
}

```
This is a very simple Employee class having 4 auto-implemented public properties, and 2 public methods. Now, let us consume the above class. Please modify the Program class which contains the Main method as shown below. Here, we are creating an instance of the Employee class and setting values for the four properties, and then invoking the DisplayFullName and DisplayEmployeeDetails method which is going to display the employee’s full name and employee information on the console window.

```C#
using System;
namespace PartialClassDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Employee emp = new Employee
            {
                FirstName = "Pranaya",
                LastName = "Rout",
                Salary = 100000,
                Gender = "Male"
            };
            emp.DisplayFullName();
            emp.DisplayEmployeeDetails();
            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}

```

##### **Splitting Above Class Definition into 2 Files using Partial Classes in C#.** 

Now what we are going to do is, we will split the above Employee class definition into two different class files. One class file is going to contain all 4 public auto-implemented properties (FirstName, LastName, Gender, and Salary), and the other class file is going to contain the two public methods i.e. DisplayFullName and DisplayEmployeeDetails that we have defined inside the Employee class.

First, delete the Employee.cs class file from the project. Then we need to add two class files with the name PartialEmployeeOne and PartialEmployeeTwo. The PartialEmployeeOne class file going to contain all 4 public auto-implemented properties (FirstName, LastName, Gender, and Salary), and the PartialEmployeeTwo class file going to contain the two public DisplayFullName and DisplayEmployeeDetails methods. Even though the class file names are different, the class name is going to be the same, and in this case, we are providing the class name as  PartialEmployee in both the class file as well as we are making the class as partial by using the partial keyword.

###### **Adding** **PartialEmployeeOne.cs**

In order to add the PartialEmployeeOne.cs class file, right-click on the project and then add a class file with the name PartialEmployeeOne.cs and then copy and paste the following code into it. Notice that in the below code, the PartialEmployee class is marked with the partial keyword and it contains only the 4 public properties as per our requirements.

```C#
namespace PartialClassDemo

{

public partial class PartialEmployee

{

public string FirstName { get; set; }

public string LastName { get; set; }

public string Gender { get; set; }

public double Salary { get; set; }

}

}
```
**Note:** Here the class file name is PartialEmployeeOne.cs but the class name is PartialEmployee and the class is marked with the partial keyword which makes it a partial class.

###### **Adding** **PartialEmployeeTwo.cs**

Now let us add the PartialEmployeeTwo.cs class file to our project. To do so, right-click on the project and add a class file with the name PartialEmployeeTwo.cs and then copy and paste the following code into it. Notice that in the below code, the PartialEmployee class is also marked with the partial keyword and it contains only the two public methods as per our requirements. But the point that you need to observe is, here, we are able to access the properties that are defined in PartialEmployeeOne.cs class file and this is possible because of the partial class.

```C#
using System;
namespace PartialClassDemo
{
    public partial class PartialEmployee
    {
        public void DisplayFullName()
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Full Name is : {FirstName} {LastName}");
        }

        public void DisplayEmployeeDetails()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Employee Details : ");
            Console.WriteLine($"First Name : {FirstName}");
            Console.WriteLine($"Last Name : {LastName}");
            Console.WriteLine($"Gender : {Gender}");
            Console.WriteLine($"Salary : {Salary}");
        }
    }
}

```


##### **Rules to follow while working with Partial Classes in C#:**

**Rule1:** All the parts that contain the class definition must use the partial keyword. All the parts must be available at compile time to form the final type. Otherwise, we will get a compilation error stating **Missing partial modifier. Another partial declaration of this type exists.** For a better understanding, please have a look at the below example code. Here, we can see that in this first definition we have uses the partial keyword and but in the second definition of the class, we have not used the partial keyword, and hence the compiler throws one compilation error.
![[word-image-29911-4-3.webp]]

**Rule2:** All the parts of the partial class must have the same access modifier. If we try to use different access modifiers in different parts of the partial class, then we will get a compilation error saying that **Partial declarations have conflicting accessibility modifiers.** For a better understanding, please have a look at the below example code. Here, you can see that in the first definition of the PartialEmployee class we have used public access specifier, and in the second definition of the PartialEmployee class we have used internal access specifier and hence the compiler throws one compilation error.
![[word-image-29911-5-2.webp]]

**Rule3:** If any of the parts are declared as abstract, then the entire type is considered as abstract or if any of the parts are declared as sealed, then the entire type is considered as sealed or if any of the parts inherit a class, then the entire type inherits that class**.** Here, you can see, one of the parts we declared as abstract, and hence the complete class becomes abstract and as we know we cannot create an instance of an abstract class. And here when we are trying to create an instance of the PartialEmployee class which is an abstract class, the compiler throws one compilation error.

![[DotNet/CShapr/2.OOPs/images/word-image-29911-6-2.webp]]

**Rule4:** C#.NET does not support multiple class inheritance that we already discussed in our [**Multiple Inheritance**](https://dotnettutorials.net/lesson/multiple-inheritance-csharp/) article become of the ambiguity problem. That means different parts of the partial class must not specify different base classes. If we specify different bases class, then we will get a compilation error saying **Partial declarations must not specify different base classes**. For a better understanding, please have a look at the below example code. Here, you can see that one part of the Partial Class inherits from the Employee base class and the other part of the Partial class inherits from the Customer base. That means now the Partial class has two base classes making this multiple inheritance with classes which is not possible in C# and hence the compiler throws one compilation error.
![[word-image-29911-7 1.webp]]

**Rule5:** But it is possible with Partial classes that the different parts of the partial class can specify different base interfaces and the final type should and must implement all the interface methods. In the following example, the PartialClass needs to provide the implementation for both IEmployee and ICustomer interface methods. This is possible because a class can not have more than one base class, but a class can have more than one base interface and this is how we can implement multiple inheritances in C# with interfaces.

```C#
namespace PartialClassDemo
{
    public interface IEmployee
    {
        void EmployeeMethod();
    }
    public interface ICustomer
    {
        void CustomerMethod();
    }
    public partial class PartialClass : IEmployee
    {
        public void EmployeeMethod()
        {
            //Method Implementation
        }
    }
    public partial class PartialClass : ICustomer
    {
        public void CustomerMethod()
        {
            //Method Implementation
        }
    }
}

```

**Note:** Any members that are declared in a partial definition are available to all of the other parts of the partial class. Once we understand Partial Classes, now let’s move further and try to understand Partial Methods in C#.

##### **What are Partial Methods in C#?**

A partial class may contain a partial method. One part of the class contains the signature of the method. An implementation of the Partial Method can be defined in the same part or other parts of the Partial Class. If the implementation is not supplied, then the method and all calls to the partial method are removed by the compiler at the time of compilation.

Let us understand partial methods with an example. Create a console application. Add a class file with the name PartialClassOne.cs to the project and then copy and paste the following code into it.

```C#
using System;
namespace PartialClassDemo
{
    partial class PartialClass
    {
        // Declaration of the partial method.
        partial void PartialMethod();

        // A public method calling the partial method
        public void PublicMethod()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Public Method Invoked");
            PartialMethod();
        }
    }
}

```

```c#
using System;
namespace PartialClassDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            PartialClass SC = new PartialClass();
            SC.PublicMethod();
            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}

```

##### **Rules to Follow while working with Partial Methods in C#:**

**Rule1:** Partial methods in C# are private by default and we can use any access specifier explicitly, and if we try to use any access specifier explicitly like public, private, protected, etc, then we will get a compiler stating **A partial method cannot have access modifiers or the virtual, abstract, override, new, sealed, or extern modifiers.** For a better understanding, please have a look at the below example code. Here, we are explicitly trying to use a private access modifier with the partial method, and hence the compiler throws an error.

![[word-image-29911-10.webp]]

**Rule2:** Partial method declaration and implementation should not be at the same time. Its declaration should be at one place and its implementation must be at a different place either in the same part or in other parts of the partial class. If we include both declaration and implementation at the same time, then we will get a compiler error saying **No defining declaration found for implementing declaration of partial method ‘PartialDemo.PartialClass.partialMethod()’**. For a better understanding, please have a look at the below example code. Here, we are declaring and implementing the partial method at the same time and hence we are getting a compiler error.
![[word-image-29911-11 1.webp]]

**Rule3:** A partial method return type must be void. If we try to use any other return type like int, string, bool, etc. then we will get a compiler error saying **Partial methods must have a void return type.** For a better understanding, please have a look at the below example code. Here, we are trying to make the return type as int and hence the compiler throws an error.
![[word-image-29911-12 1.webp]]

**Rule4:** A partial method must and should be declared within a partial class or partial struct. A non-partial class or struct cannot include partial methods. If we try to define a partial method under a non-partial class or struct, then we will get a compile-time error saying **A partial method must be declared within a partial class or partial struct**. For a better understanding, please have a look at the below code. Here, we are trying to define a partial method under a non-partial class and hence the compiler throws an error.


![[Partial-Class-and-Partial-Method-in-C.webp]]

**Rule5:** The signature of the partial method declaration must match the signature of the implementation else we will get a compilation error. For a better understanding, please have a look at the following code. Here, in the first part of the partial class, we have defined the partial method with one integer parameter and in the second part of the partial class where we are providing the implementation, we are not including the integer parameter and hence the compiler throws an error.
![[word-image-29911-14 1.webp]]

**Rule6:** A partial method can be implemented only once either in the same part or in other parts of the partial class. If we try to implement a partial method more than once, then we will get a compilation error saying **A partial method may not have multiple implementing declarations.** For a better understanding, please have a look at the below example code. Here, in the first part, we have declared the partial method and in the second part and in the part we are providing implementation to the partial method, and as we are providing two implementations we are getting the compilation error. This is because, in a class, we cannot define two methods with the same name and same parameters i.e. method overriding is not possible in a single class.
