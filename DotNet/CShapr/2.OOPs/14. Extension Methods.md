##### **What are Extension Methods in C#?**

It is a new feature that has been added in C# 3.0 which allows us to add new methods into a class without editing the source code of the class i.e. if a class consists of a set of members in it and in the future if you want to add new methods into the class, you can add those methods without making any changes to the source code of the class.

Extension methods can be used as an approach to extending the functionality of a class in the future if the source code of the class is not available or we don’t have any permission in making changes to the class.

Before extension methods, inheritance is an approach that is used for extending the functionality of a class i.e. if we want to add any new members to an existing class without making a modification to the class, we will define a child class to that existing class and then we add new members in the child class.

In the case of an extension method, we will extend the functionality of an existing class. In this case, we will create a new class and by using that new class we will extend the functionality of an existing class.

Both these approaches can be used for extending the functionalities of an existing class whereas, in the case of inheritance, we call the methods defined in the old and new classes by using the object of the new class whereas, in the case of extension methods, we call the old and new methods by using the object of the old class.

**Note:** Sometimes inheritance is not possible. That means if the class is declared using the sealed modifier, then we cannot create a derived class from the sealed. But we can extend the functionality of sealed class using the Extension Method.


##### **Example to Understand Extension Methods in C#:**

Let us understand Extension Methods in C# with an example. First, create a console application and then add a class file with the name OldClass.cs and then copy and paste the following code into it. As you can see in the below code, here we created the OldClass with one data member i.e. x, and two methods i.e. Test1 and Test2.

```C#
using System;
namespace ExtensionMethods
{
    public class OldClass
    {
        public int x = 100;
        public void Test1()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Method one: " + this.x);
        }
        public void Test2()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Method two: " + this.x);
        }
    }
}

```
Now our requirement is to add three new methods to the class OldClass. For some reason, let us assume the source code is not available to us or we don’t have access to the source to edit. That means we cannot change the source code of OldClass. Then how we can extend the OldClass functionality i.e. how we can add three methods to the OldClass and how we can call those new methods using the OldClass object. This is where extension methods come into the picture.

So, we can extend the functionality of OldClass with the help of extension methods. Let’s create a new class with the name NewClass.cs and then copy and paste the following code into it.

```C#
using System;
namespace ExtensionMethods
{
    public static class NewClass
    {
        public static void Test3(this OldClass O)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Method Three");
        }
        public static void Test4(this OldClass O, int x)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Method Four: " + x);
        }
        public static void Test5(this OldClass O)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Method Five:" + O.x);
        }
    }
}

```

```C#
using System;
namespace ExtensionMethods
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            OldClass obj = new OldClass();
            obj.Test1();
            obj.Test2();
            //Calling Extension Methods
            obj.Test3();
            obj.Test4(10);
            obj.Test5();
            Console.ReadLine();
        }
    }
}

```

##### **Extension Method Real-Time Example in C#:**

```C#
using System.Linq;
namespace ExtensionMethods
{
    public static class StringExtension
    {
        public static int GetWordCount(this string inputstring)
        {
            if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(inputstring))
            {
                //Split the string by a space
                string[] strArray = inputstring.Split(' ');
                return strArray.Count();
            }
            else
            {
                return 0;
            }
        }
    }
}

```

```c#
using System;
namespace ExtensionMethods
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            string myWord = "Welcome to Dotnet Tutorials Extension Methods Article";
            int wordCount = myWord.GetWordCount();
            Console.WriteLine("string : " + myWord);
            Console.WriteLine("Count : " + wordCount);
            Console.Read();
        }
    }
}

```
