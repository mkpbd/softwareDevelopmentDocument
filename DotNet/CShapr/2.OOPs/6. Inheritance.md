##### **What is Inheritance in C#?**

Inheritance in C# is a mechanism of consuming the members that are defined in one class from another class. See, we are aware that a class is a collection of members. The members defined in one class can be consumed by another class by establishing a parent/child relationship between the classes.

Generally, we all know that all of our parent properties belong to us. So, children get rights on the Parent’s property. Why? Because this is a law. According to the law, all parents’ properties belong to their children.

Exactly the same principle is applied in inheritance. Suppose I have a class (A) with a set of members, and I want the same members in another class (B). One way to do this is to copy and paste the same code from class A into class B. But if we copy and paste the code, then it is called rewriting the code. Rewriting the code has an impact on the size of the application. If the size of the application grows, ultimately, it will affect the performance of the application.

So, if you want to overcome that rewriting process and reuse the code, the best option that is available for us is Inheritance in C#. Simply. what we need to do is establish a Relation between the two classes. What relation? Parent/Child relation. Once you establish the parent/child relationship, then all the members of the parent class (A) can be consumed under the child class (B). For a better understanding, please have a look at the following diagram.

![[word-image-1175-1.webp]]

So, Inheritance in C# is a mechanism of consuming the members of one class in another class by establishing a parent/child relationship between the classes, which provides re-usability.

##### **How to Implement Inheritance in C#?**

To Implement Inheritance in C#, we need to establish a Parent/Child relationship between classes. Let us understand how to establish a Parent/Child relationship in C#. Suppose we have a class called A with a set of members. And we have another class B, and we want this class B to be inherited from class A. The following code shows how to establish the Parent-Child relationship between Class A and Class B.

![[word-image-1175-2.webp]]

So, this is the basic process for establishing a Parent/Child relationship in C#. Now, let us see the basic syntax to establish a Parent/Child relationship between classes. The syntax is given below.

`[<modifiers>] class <child class> : <parent class>`

Here, the terminology Parent Class and Child Class can also be called Base Class (Superclass) and Derived Class (Subclass). So, in our example,  
A => Parent/ Base/ Superclass (all meaning the same; you can use any term)  
B => Child/ Derived/ Subclass (all meaning the same; you can use any term)

**Note:** In Inheritance, the Child class can consume members of its Parent class as if it is the owner of those members (except private members of the parent).


##### **Why Child Cannot Consume Private Members of Parent?**

Generally, Children have rights to their Parent’s Property. As a Child, tomorrow, I can take over my father’s business. I can take over my Father’s Properties (Car, Buildings, Money, whatever it is). But I cannot take over my father’s job. The reason is the Job whatever my father is doing may be based on his qualifications and his experiences. And tomorrow I cannot take over his particular job. So, the Job is completely private to my father. And that is not inherited by me. But remain everything, business, money, properties, whatever I will take. Take over everything except the private members.

The same principle is also applied to Inheritance. So, the child class will consume all the members of the Parent class except the private members.

##### **Example to Understand Inheritance in C#:**

Let us see a simple example to understand Inheritance in C#. Let us create a class with two methods, as shown below.

```C#
class A
{
    public void Method1()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Method 1");
    }
    public void Method2()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Method 2");
    }
}

```


Here, we have created class A with two public methods, i.e., Method1 and Method2. Now, I want the same two methods in another class, i.e., class B. One way to do this is to copy the above two methods and paste them into class B as follows.

```C#
class B
{
    public void Method1()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Method 1");
    }
    public void Method2()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Method 2");
    }
}

```

Once you perform the Inheritance, class B can take the two members defined in class A. Why? Because all the properties of a Parent belong to Children. Here, class A is the Parent/Super/Base class, and Class B is the Child/Sub/Derived class.

![[word-image-1175-3.webp]]

The complete code example is given below. In the below example, class A defined two members, and class B is inherited from Class A. In class B, within the Main method, we created an instance of class B and called the two methods.

```C#
using System;
namespace InheritanceDemo
{
    class A
    {
        public void Method1()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Method 1");
        }
        public void Method2()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Method 2");
        }
    }
    class B : A
    {
        static void Main()
        {
            B obj = new B();
            obj.Method1();
            obj.Method2();
            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}

```

The complete code example is given below. In the below example, class A defined two members, and class B is inherited from Class A. In class B, within the Main method, we created an instance of class B and called the two methods.
```C#
using System;
namespace InheritanceDemo
{
    class A
    {
        public void Method1()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Method 1");
        }
        public void Method2()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Method 2");
        }
    }
    class B : A
    {
        static void Main()
        {
            B obj = new B();
            obj.Method1();
            obj.Method2();
            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}

```

![[word-image-1175-5.webp]]
```C#
using System;
namespace InheritanceDemo
{
    class A
    {
        public void Method1()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Method 1");
        }
        public void Method2()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Method 2");
        }
    }
    class B : A
    {
        public void Method3()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Method 3");
        }
        static void Main()
        {
            B obj = new B();
            obj.Method1();
            obj.Method2();
            obj.Method3();
            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}

```

##### **So, what is a Reference in C#?**

References of a class will not have any memory allocation. They will be consuming the memory of the instance that is assigned to initialize them. For a better understanding, please have a look at the below diagram. Here, whenever we create an instance, memory is allocated for q. This instance will contain information about both Parent A and Child B classes. And p is a reference. And p is consuming the memory of q.

![[word-image-1175-13.webp]]
**Note:** The point that you need to remember is memory allocation is done for instances, not for references in C#. References are just pointers to instances.

Now, if observed, both p and q are accessing the same memory. But the point to understand is that even though p and q are accessing the same memory, using p, I cannot call any child class members. See the following diagram. As you can see in the diagram below, using p, we cannot call class B members, but using q, we can call both A and B class members.
![[word-image-1175-14.webp]]

##### **Rule4:**

Every class that is defined by us or predefined in the libraries of the language has a default parent class, i.e., the Object class of the System namespace, so the members (Equals, GetHashCode, GetType, and ToString) of the Object class are accessible from anywhere.

Generally, when we define a class, we think that we did not inherit it from any class. But by default, our class is Inherited from the Object class. So, Object is the parent class for all the classes defined in our Base Class Library as well as all the classes that we defined in our application.

Because Object is the parent class, four important methods (Equals, GetHashCode, GetType, and ToString) of the Object class can be called or accessed from anywhere. For a better understanding, please have a look at the below image. Here, we have created an instance of Object class, and when we say obj., the intelligence shows the four methods.

![[word-image-1175-15.webp]]

Remember the above four methods can be accessed from everywhere. Every class can contain the Equals, GetHashCode, GetType, and ToString methods, and this is possible because every class in the .NET framework is inherited from the Object class.

Now, let us create an object of class A, and when you type obj., then the intelligence shows 6 methods, i.e., 2 methods (Method1 and Method2) from class A and four methods (Equals, GetHashCode, GetType, and ToString) from Object class shown in the below image.

**Note:** Object class supports all classes in the .NET Framework class hierarchy and provides low-level services to derived classes. This is the ultimate base class of all classes in the .NET Framework; it is the root of the type hierarchy.

##### **What is the Default Parent Class in C#?**

The Default Parent class is the Object class present in the System namespace.

```C#
using System;
namespace InheritanceDemo
{
    class A
    {
        public A()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Class A Constructor is Called");
        }
        public void Method1()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Method 1");
        }
        public void Method2()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Method 2");
        }
    }
    class B : A
    {
        public B()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Class B Constructor is Called");
        }
        public void Method3()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Method 3");
        }
        static void Main()
        {
            Object obj1 = new Object();
            Console.WriteLine($"obj1 type: {obj1.GetType()}");
            A obj2 = new A();
            Console.WriteLine($"obj2 type: {obj2.GetType()}");
            B obj3 = new B();
            Console.WriteLine($"obj3 type: {obj3.GetType()}");

            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}

```

##### **Rule5:**

In C#, we don’t have support for multiple inheritances through classes. What we are provided is only a Single Inheritance through classes. That means with classes, only one immediate parent class is allowed (i.e., Single, Multilevel, and Hierarchical supported), and more than one immediate parent class is not allowed in C# with classes (i.e., Multiple and Hybrid are not supported). In our next article, we will discuss this rule in detail.

##### **Rule6:**

In Rule1, we learned whenever the child class instance is created, the child class constructor will implicitly call its parent classes constructor, but if the parent classes constructor is parameterless. If the constructor of the Parent class is parameterized, then the Child class constructor cannot implicitly call its Parent’s constructor. So, to overcome this problem, it is the responsibility of the programmer to explicitly call the Parent classes constructor from the child class constructor and pass values to those parameters. To call the Parent’s constructor from the child class, we need to use the base keyword.

```C#
using System;
namespace InheritanceDemo
{
    class A
    {
        public A(int number)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Class A Constructor is Called : {number}");
        }
        public void Method1()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Method 1");
        }
        public void Method2()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Method 2");
        }
    }
    class B : A
    {
        public B()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Class B Constructor is Called");
        }
        public void Method3()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Method 3");
        }
        static void Main()
        {
      B obj = new B();
            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}

```

##### **Why is it unable to call the constructor?**
Earlier, the constructor was parameterless, so it directly calls the Parent class constructor. Right now, the constructor is parameterized. If you want to call it, you require a value now. The class B constructor does not know what value to pass the class A constructor. This is the reason why we are getting an error in class B, not in class A. Why? Because class B is not able to call the class A constructor.

```
```
![[word-image-1175-19.webp]]

So, here we are passing the value 10 to the Parent class, i.e., A constructor. This value of 10 will be received by the parent class constructor. The complete code is given below.

```C#
using System;
namespace InheritanceDemo
{
    class A
    {
        public A(int number)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Class A Constructor is Called : {number}");
        }
        public void Method1()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Method 1");
        }
        public void Method2()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Method 2");
        }
    }

    class B : A
    {
        public B() : base(10)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Class B Constructor is Called");
        }
        public void Method3()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Method 3");
        }
        static void Main()
        {
            B obj = new B();
            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}

```

##### **How to pass dynamic value to Parent class constructor in C#?**
 we have hardcoded the value, i.e., 10. So, every time we create an instance, the same value will be assigned to the parent constructor. But if we want, then we can also pass dynamic value. Let us see this with an example. In the below example, the child class, i.e., class B constructor, takes one parameter and passes that parameter value to the parent class, i.e., Class A constructor. And when we are creating the instance of Class B, we need to pass the parameter value.
```C#
using System;
namespace InheritanceDemo
{
    class A
    {
        public A(int number)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Class A Constructor is Called : {number}");
        }
        public void Method1()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Method 1");
        }
        public void Method2()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Method 2");
        }
    }

    class B : A
    {
        public B(int num) : base(num)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Class B Constructor is Called");
        }
        public void Method3()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Method 3");
        }
        static void Main()
        {
            B obj1 = new B(10);
            B obj2 = new B(20);
            B obj3 = new B(30);
            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}

```


# Types of Inheritance

1. Single Inheritance
2. Multi-Level Inheritance
3. Hierarchical Inheritance
4. Hybrid Inheritance
5. Multiple Inheritance
##### **Single Inheritance:**

When a class is inherited from a single base class then the inheritance is called single inheritance.
![[single-inheritance-in-c.webp]]
we have a class called A that is the Parent class and another class called B that is the Child class, and class B is inheriting from class A. I.e. Class B has a single Parent class i.e. class A. This type of inheritance is called Single Inheritance.

##### **Multilevel Inheritance:**

When a derived class is created from another derived class, then such a type of inheritance is called Multilevel Inheritance.

![[multilevel-inheritance-in-c.webp]]
If there is a class called A and from class A, class B is inheriting and from class B, class C is inheriting, then such type of inheritance is called Multilevel Inheritance.

##### **Hierarchical Inheritance:**

When more than one derived class is created from a single base class then it is called Hierarchical inheritance.

![[hierarchical-inheritance-in-c.webp]]
Now, if you have a class called A and from this class A, if more than one class inheriting i.e. class B is inheriting, class C is inheriting as well as class D is inheriting i.e. when more than one child class is inheriting from a Single Base Class, then such a type of inheritance is called Hierarchical Inheritance.

##### **Multiple Inheritance:**

When a derived class is created from more than one base class then such type of inheritance is called multiple inheritances.

![[multiple-inheritance-in-c.webp]]

If there are classes A and B and from both of them class C is inheriting, then such type of inheritance is called Multiple Inheritance. So, when one class is having multiple parent classes then such type of inheritance is called Multiple Inheritance.

##### **Hybrid Inheritance:**

Hybrid Inheritance is the inheritance that is the combination of any Single, Hierarchical, and Multilevel inheritances.

![[word-image-27667-5.webp]]

There are two subclasses i.e. B and C which are inheriting from class A (this is Hierarchical inheritance). Then from B and C, there is one more class that is D inherits from B and C. Now, this is a combination of hierarchical inheritance from the top and multiple inheritances (D is inheriting from B and C) from the bottom. Further, from A to B and from B to C i.e. Multi-level Inheritance. So, if you have this type of inheritance then the features of base class A will be appearing in class D via class B and class C. This type of Inheritance is called Hybrid Inheritance


##### **Example to Understand Single Inheritance in C#:**
```C#
using System;
namespace InheritanceDemo
{
    public class Program
    {
        static void Main()
        {
            // Creating object of Child class and
            // invoke the methods of Parent and Child classes
            Cuboid obj =  new Cuboid(2, 4, 6);
            Console.WriteLine($"Volume is : {obj.Volume()}");
            Console.WriteLine($"Area is : {obj.Area()}");
            Console.WriteLine($"Perimeter is : {obj.Perimeter()}");
            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
    //Parent class
    public class Rectangle
    {
        public int length;
        public int breadth;
        public int Area()
        {
            return length * breadth;
        }
        public int Perimeter()
        {
            return 2 * (length + breadth);
        }
    }
    
    //Child Class
    class Cuboid : Rectangle
    {
        public int height;
        public Cuboid(int l, int b, int h)
        {
            length = l;
            breadth = b;
            height = h;
        }
        public int Volume()
        {
            return length * breadth * height;
        }
    }
}

```

##### **Example to Understand Multiple Inheritance in C#:**

```C#
using System;
namespace InheritanceDemo
{
    public class Program
    {
        static void Main()
        {
            // Creating object of Child class and
            // invoke the methods of Parent classes and Child class
            SmartPhone obj = new SmartPhone(); ;
            obj.GetPhoneModel();
            obj.GetCameraDetails();
            obj.GetDetails();

            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
    //Parent Class 1
    class Phone
    {
        public void GetPhoneModel()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Redmi Note 5 Pro");
        }
    }
    //Parent class2
    class Camera
    {
        public void GetCameraDetails()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("24 Mega Pixel Camera");
        }
    }

    //Child Class derived from more than one Parent class
    class SmartPhone : Phone, Camera
    {
        public void GetDetails()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Its a RedMi Smart Phone");
        }
    }
}

```

**Note:** Handling the complexity caused due to multiple inheritances is very complex. Hence it was not supported in dot net with class and it can be done with interfaces. So, in our [**Multiple Inheritance**](https://dotnettutorials.net/lesson/multiple-inheritance-csharp/) articles, we will discuss this concept in detail.

##### **Classification of Inheritance in C#**

C#.NET classified the inheritance into two categories, such as

1. **Implementation inheritance:** Whenever a class is derived from another class then it is known as implementation inheritance.
2. **Interface inheritance:** Whenever a class is derived from an interface then it is known as interface inheritance.

##### **How to use Inheritance in Application Development?**

Inheritance is something that comes into the picture, not in the middle of a project or middle of application development. This can also come in the middle of the project development but generally when we start application development, in the initial stages only we plan inheritance and implement it in our project.

##### **What is an Entity?**

In DBMS terminology what is an Entity? An Entity is something that is associated with a set of attributes. An Entity can be a living or non-living object. But anything that is associated with a set of attributes is called Entity.

Remember, when we are going to develop an application, our application mainly deals with these Entities. Suppose, you are developing an application for a Bank. So, the Entity associated with the bank is a customer. A customer is an Entity. You are developing an application for a school; the Student will be the Entity. Suppose, you are developing an application for a business, then Employee is an entity. So, every application that we develop is associated with a set of entities.

Can we call a phone an Entity? Yes, we can call a phone an entity. It’s not a living object but it can be called an entity. It has some attributes such as Company that manufacture the phone, the model number, the price, the size, the weight, etc.
The student is a living Entity. All students have some attributes such as Id, Name, Address, Phone number, and the class in which the student studies.

The employee is a living Entity. Employees have some attributes such as Employee number, name, job, department, Salary, etc.

##### **Application Development Process:**

So, generally, when we are developing an application, the process will be as follows.

##### **Step1: Identify the Entities that are associated with the application**

Suppose, we are developing an application for a School. Then for this Student Application, who are the entities. The Student is an Entity. TeachingStaff is an Entity. NonTeachingStaff is another Entity. Like this, we can identify the entities. So, in our application, we have identified three entities.

**Entities: Student, TeachingStaff, NonTeachingStaff**

##### **Step2: Identify the attributes of each and every entity.**

**Entity: Student**  
**Student Attributes:** Id, Name, Address, Phone, Class, Marks, Grade, Fees

**Entity: TeachingStaff**  
**TeachingStaff Attributes:** Id, Name, Address, Phone, Designation, Salary, Qualification, Subject

**Entity: NonTeachingStaff**  
**NonTeachingStaff Attributes:** Id, Name, Address, Phone, Designation, Salary, DeptName, ManagerId

For a better understanding, please have a look at the below diagram.

![[word-image-27669-1.webp]]

##### **Step3: Identify the common attributes and put them in a hierarchical order**

See the following diagram for a better understanding. The Person contains four attributes Id, Name, Address, and Phone. Under the Person, we have Student and Staff. The Student inherits from the Person, so by default Student will get all those four attributes, and the rest of all other attributes are defined inside the Student Entity. Then we Staff Entity which is also inherited from Person and hence all those four common attributes are also available and plus we have defined the common attributes for Teaching and NonTeaching entities inside the Staff entity. So, Staff will contain six attributes. Finally, both Teaching and NonTeaching are inherited from the Staff Entity.


![[word-image-27669-2.webp]]

So, tomorrow if temporary staff comes into the picture, then also these properties are applicable to Temporary Staff. What you need to do is, create a new Entity with the specific properties and inherit it from the Staff entity.

##### **Step4: Defining the classes that are representing the entities in Hierarchical order**

After identifying of attributes of each entity, next, we need to define classes representing each and every entity. That is one class representing students, one class representing teaching staff, and another class representing the non-teaching staff. But, if we are defining three classes representing one entity, then there is a problem. The problem is there are some common attributes in each entity. So, if we start defining three classes individually, then there is code duplication. Why code duplication? See, we need to define Id three times, Name three times, Address three times, and Phone number three times. Like this, we have duplication in the code.

And we are working with an object-oriented programming language, not a procedure-oriented programming language and the strength of an object-oriented programming language is code re-usability, not code duplication. If we cannot make use of reusability, then there is no point coming into object-oriented programming.

So, what we need to do is we need to eliminate the redundancy or duplicates. See, in procedure-oriented language, we use structure to represent the entity. In DBMS we use tables to represent entities and in object-oriented programming, we use classes to represent entities.

Unfortunately, the structure does not support inheritance. A structure does not support inheritance, I require to define three entities with duplicate attributes. Id, Name, Address, and Phone number need to be duplicated in all three structures. And this is completely against the standard of object-oriented programming.

For all the three entities which are the common attributes? Id, Name, Address, and Phone are the common attributes. Let us put these common attributes in a class called Person. Once we define this class and once, we make this class a Parent class, then no need to define these attributes three times. One time we need to declare in the parent class and then we are consuming these properties under all the child classes. That means reusability comes into the picture.


```C#
public class Person
{
    public int Id;
    public string Name;
    public string Address;
    public string Phone;
}

public class Student : Person

{

public int Class;

public float Fees;

public float Marks;

public char Grade;

}

public class Staff : Person
{
    string Designation;
    double Salary;
}

public class Teaching : Staff
{
    string Qualification;
    string Subject;
}
public class NonTeaching : Staff
{
    string Deptname;
    string ManagerId;
}

```

##### **How to Make use of Inheritance in Realtime Application Development?**

Generally, when we develop an application, we will be following a process as follows.

1. Identify the entity associated with the application
2. Identify the attribute that is associated with the application.
3. Now separate the attribute of each entity in a hierarchical order without having any duplicates.
4. Convert those entities into classes.

##### **Another Realtime Example to Understand Inheritance in C#:**

Acquiring the features of an existing class that is the base class into a new class that is derived class is known as inheritance. Inheritance is deriving a class from an existing class. So, what does it mean? Let us understand this through some real-time examples. We are taking the example of automobile engineering. Suppose, a car company has designed a car as shown in the below image.
