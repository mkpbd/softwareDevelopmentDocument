##### **IsA and HasA Relationship in C#**

In C#, like in many other object-oriented programming languages, the concepts of “IsA” and “HasA” relationships are fundamental to understanding inheritance and composition, respectively. These relationships help design the structure of classes and objects in a program.

##### **IsA Relationship (Inheritance):**

**Definition:** The IsA relationship is achieved through inheritance. It represents a hierarchical relationship between a base class (parent) and derived classes (children). In an IsA relationship, the derived class is a specialized version of the base class.  
**Characteristics:**

- **Inheritance**: The derived class inherits properties and methods from the base class.
- **Polymorphism**: The derived class can override or extend the functionalities of the base class.
- **Substitutability**: Objects of the derived class can be treated as base class objects.

##### **HasA Relationship (Composition):**

**Definition:** The HasA relationship is used to denote usage or composition. It indicates that an object of one class “contains” or “is composed of” objects from another class. This relationship is less tightly coupled than inheritance.  
**Characteristics:**

- **Composition:** A class contains or is composed of objects from another class.
- **Independence:** The contained object (e.g., Engine) can exist independently of the container (e.g., Car).
- **Encapsulation:** The internal workings of the contained object are usually hidden from the outside class.
- **Flexibility and Reusability:** Objects can be easily replaced or changed, providing more flexibility in code design.

##### **IsA and HasA Relationship in C# with Examples:**

Let us understand the IS-A and HAS-A Relationship in C# with one example. Please have a look at the example below.

**class Rectangle{**  
          **Some Data Members**  
          **Some Member Functions**  
**}**

This is a class called Rectangle. Let us assume we have some data members and member functions there inside this class. Next, we have a class called Cuboid, which is inheriting from the above Rectangle class as follows.

**class Cuboid : Rectangle{**  
          **Some Data Members**  
          **Some Member Functions**  
**}**

This is the Cuboid class, which is inherited from the Rectangle class. Also, assume that this class also has some data members and member functions inside it. Now let us write one more class as follows.

**class Table{**  
       **Rectangle top;**  
       **int legs;**  
**}**

This is the Table class, which is not inherited from any class. This class has two data members. One of the data members is of class Rectangle, and the other is of integer type variable, i.e., top and legs.


So first, we created a class called Rectangle. Then we created another class called Cuboid, which is inherited from the Rectangle class, and then we created another class called Table. Inside the Table class, we created one variable of the type Rectangle and another of integer type.

##### **Real-time Example to Understand Is-A and Has-A Relationship:**

Let us understand **IS-A** and **HAS-A** relationships with one Real-time Example. Let us take an example. Please have a look at the below image.

##### **Example to Understand IS-A Relationship in C#**

Please have a look at the example below. In the below example, the relation between Rectangle and Cuboid is IS-A relationship, so we can say that Cuboid IS-A Rectangle.

```C#
using System;
namespace IsAHasADemo
{
    public class Program
    {
        static void Main()
        {
            Cuboid cuboid = new Cuboid(3, 5, 7);
            Console.WriteLine($"Volume is : {cuboid.Volume()}");
            Console.WriteLine($"Area is : {cuboid.Area()}");
            Console.WriteLine($"Perimeter is : {cuboid.Perimeter()}");

            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
    class Rectangle
    {
        //Data Members
        public int Length;
        public int Breadth;

        //Member Functions
        public int Area()
        {
            return Length * Breadth;
        }
        public int Perimeter()
        {
            return 2 * (Length + Breadth);
        }
    }

    //Establishing Parent-Child Relationship
    //IS-A Relationship i.e. Cuboid IS-A Rectangle
    class Cuboid : Rectangle
    {
        public int Height;
        public Cuboid(int l, int b, int h)
        {
            Length = l;
            Breadth = b;
            Height = h;
        }
        public int Volume()
        {
            return Length * Breadth * Height;
        }
    }
}

```

##### **Example to Understand HAS-A Relationship in C#**
Please have a look at the example below. In the example below, within the Employee class, we have created one variable of Address type, which is nothing but a HAS-A relationship between Employee and Address. So, we can say that Employee HAS-A Address.

```C#
using System;
namespace IsAHasADemo
{
    public class Program
    {
        static void Main()
        {
            Address address = new Address("B1-3029", "BBSR", "Odisha");
            Employee employee = new Employee(1001, "Ramesh", address);
            employee.Display();
            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
    class Address
    {
        public string AddressLine, City, State;
        public Address(string addressLine, string city, string state)
        {
            AddressLine = addressLine;
            City = city;
            State = state;
        }
    }
    class Employee
    {
        //Using Address in Employee class
        //Establishing Has-A relationship i.e. Employee HAS-A Address   
        public Address address; 
        public int Id;
        public string Name;
        public Employee(int id, string name, Address adrs)
        {
            Id = id;
            Name = name;
            address = adrs;
        }
        public void Display()
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Employee Id: {Id}");
            Console.WriteLine($"Employee Name: {Name}");
            Console.WriteLine($"AddressLine: {address.AddressLine}");
            Console.WriteLine($"City: {address.City}");
            Console.WriteLine($"State: {address.State}");
        }
    }
}

```

we inherit the Employee Class from the Address class, then it does not make any sense. If we inherit, it will establish an IS-A relationship between Employee and Address classes, and it does not make sense to say Employee IS-A Address. Rather, if we implement a HAS-A relationship, then it makes sense to say Employee HAS-A Address.

##### **Differences Between IsA and HasA Relationship in C#**

- **Nature of Relationship:** IsA is an inheritance (parent-child) relationship, whereas HasA is a compositional relationship.
- **Coupling:** IsA typically implies a stronger coupling between classes, as the derived class is tightly linked to its base class. HasA implies a looser coupling, as the objects can exist independently.
- **Usage:** IsA is used when a class needs to be an extension of another class, inheriting its properties and behaviors. HasA is used when a class requires certain functionalities or properties that are encapsulated in another class.
- **Flexibility:** Composition (HasA) offers more flexibility as components can be easily replaced or modified without affecting the container class

##### **How do you decide what to implement between IS-A and HAS-A?**

Ask the question yourself. For example, if I ask you the question, which statement gives you more sense from the two statements below?  
**Employee IS-A Address**  
**Employee HAS-A Address**

Then definitely, you will tell Employee HAS-A Address gives more sense than Employee IS-A Address. If I ask you, which statement gives you a better sense of the two statements?

**BMW IS-A Car**  
**BMW HAS-A Car**  
Then, your answer will be definitely BMW IS-A Car.

**Note:** In C#, the IS-A relationship is implemented using Inheritance, and the HAS-A relationship is implemented using Composition, i.e., declaring a variable. So, whenever we declare a variable of one class inside another class, we call it a Composition, or you can say HAS-A relationship.



## **Specialization in C#**

![[Pasted image 20240417130955.png]]

**Rectangle and Cuboid really exist in the world**. Can you show me a Rectangle? Yes, you can show me some shapes that are rectangular or paper that is rectangular.

So, rectangles exist in the real world. And what about Cuboid? Yes, it also exists in the real world. Any box shape thing is a cuboid.

Note :  parent class and child class  create own Object  

##### **Example to Understand Specialization in C#:**

```c#
using System;
namespace IsAHasADemo
{
    public class Program
    {
        static void Main()
        {
            Cuboid cuboid = new Cuboid(3, 5, 7);
            Console.WriteLine($"Volume is : {cuboid.Volume()}");
            Console.WriteLine($"Area is : {cuboid.Area()}");
            Console.WriteLine($"Perimeter is : {cuboid.Perimeter()}");
            Rectangle rec = new Rectangle();
             Console.WriteLine($"Area is : {rec.Area()}")
            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
    class Rectangle
    {
        public int Length;
        public int Breadth;
        public int Area()
        {
            return Length * Breadth;
        }
        public int Perimeter()
        {
            return 2 * (Length + Breadth);
        }
    }
    class Cuboid : Rectangle
    {

        public int Height;
        public Cuboid(int l, int b, int h)
        {
            Length = l;
            Breadth = b;
            Height = h;
        }
        public int Volume()
        {
            return Length * Breadth * Height;
        }
    }
}

```

##### **Another Example to Understand specialization in C#:**

Let us take another example of cars. We have a class Innova, Innova car from Toyota company. Then there is another class called Fortuner.
![[generalization-and-specialization-in-c-with-exam-1.webp]]

Innova is a base class and Fortuner is a derived class. Innova was already existing and Fortuner is the specialized form of Innova. This is specialization. **Something is already existing and then we are deriving something from that existing one by adding some extra features.** In the real world, we can take a lot of examples of specialization. 

##### **Generalization in C#**


Let’s say we have 3 classes that are Square, Rectangle, and Circle. Then for all of these three classes, we are defining one class that is Shape. And Square, Rectangle, and Circle are inherited from the Shape class. For a better understanding, please have a look at the following diagram.

![[generalization-and-specialization-in-c.webp]]

So, among these classes which one is existing first? We know that all the shapes i.e. square, rectangle and circle really exist in the real world. So, we are calling them shapes.

Do you think Shape really exists in the real world? No. It is just a virtual term. If I asked you to show me some shapes, then you’ll be drawing a rectangle, a circle, a square, a Rhombus, etc. but you cannot show me just a shape. So, Shape is a term or generic term, or generalized term which does not exist in the real world.

These child classes which are already existing in the real world and to bring them on a common platform, we have given the word Shape which is a logical term or virtual term, it is not a real term, it does not really exist in the real world.

##### **Another Example to understand Generalization:**

Suppose you have Innova, BMW, and Audi cars. So, you can start, stop, accelerate, and change gears in any of these. So, what these are all? These all are cars. Innova, BMW, and Audi are physically available in the real world. All these are nothing but cars.

![Generalization and Specialization in C# with Examples](https://dotnettutorials.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/generalization-and-specialization-in-c-1.png?ezimgfmt=rs:326x175/rscb8/ng:webp/ngcb8 "Generalization and Specialization in C# with Examples")

So, they all are inheriting from Cars. What can you do in a car? You can drive, start, stop, change gears, etc. all these features are available in these cars. Then what about Cars? Does it really exist? No, it is a general term. Just a general term that is the logical definition of a group of things.

So, we have given a superclass to a group of classes for refereeing something. It is just like if I am looking at Innova so I can say it is a car. So, for any 4-wheelers we use the term, Car.

```C#
using System;
namespace IsAHasADemo
{
    public class Program
    {
        static void Main()
        {
            Innova innova = new Innova();
            innova.Start();
            innova.Stop();

            BMW bmw = new BMW();
            bmw.Start();
            bmw.Stop();

            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
    interface ICar
    {
        void Start();
        void Stop();
    }

    public class Innova : ICar
    {
        public void Start()
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Innova Start");
        }
        public void Stop()
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Innova Stop");
        }
    }
    public class BMW : ICar
    {
        public void Start()
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"BMW Start");
        }
        public void Stop()
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"BMW Stop");
        }
    }
}

```

##### **Summary of Generalization and Specialization in C#**

So, the point that you need to remember is both generalization and specialization achieve using only inheritance. We have seen four examples in which 2 are of specialization and 2 are of generalization. In specialization, the parent was existing and the child was defined later. In generalization, the child class was existing then we define the base class. So, specialization is a top-down approach and generalization is a bottom-up approach.

In specialization, the base class has something to give to the child class whereas, in generalization, the base class doesn’t have anything to give to their child classes. Just their purpose is to group them together so that we can easily manage all those things.
