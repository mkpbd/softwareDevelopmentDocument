In C#, abstract methods are methods declared within an abstract class or an interface that do not have a method body or implementation in the declaring class or interface. Instead, the responsibility for implementing the method is delegated to any concrete (non-abstract) class that derives from the abstract class or implements the interface.

##### **What are Abstract Classes in C#?**

In C#, an abstract class is a class that serves as a blueprint for other classes. Abstract classes cannot be instantiated directly, but they can be used as base classes for other classes that derive from them. Abstract classes are declared using the abstract keyword. They often define a common set of characteristics or behaviors that should be shared among multiple derived classes.

 We need to define the abstract method inside an abstract class only. Suppose we must write the above Add abstract method inside a Calculator class. Then, that class must be declared using the following abstract modifier.

***Note:*** ==Every abstract method declared within an abstract class must and should be implemented by the Child classes without fail; otherwise, we will get a compile-time error.==

##### **Is Abstract Class Containing Only Abstract Methods in C#?**

Don’t think an abstract class can contain only abstract methods. It can also contain non-abstract methods. You need to remember that if a class is non-abstract, it contains only non-abstract methods, but if a class is abstract, it contains both abstract and non-abstract methods in C#.


##### **Who will Provide the Implementation of Abstract Methods in C#?**

The Answer is Child Class. If you have a child class of an abstract class, then it is the responsibility of the child class to provide the implementation for all the abstract methods of the parent class. You cannot escape. Every method should be implemented. If you implement all the abstract methods, you can only consume the non-abstract method of the Parent class.

Generally, we saw in Inheritance that the child class can directly consume the members of the parent class. But here, this is not possible. You cannot consume directly. The property is under restrictions. Until and unless the child class fulfills the restrictions, the child class cannot consume the parent class members.

**Note:** To define a method as abstract or class as abstract, we need to use the abstract keyword.

**Note:** Abstract methods are commonly used within abstract classes. An abstract class cannot be instantiated; it serves as a blueprint for other classes. Abstract methods within an abstract class define a contract that any derived (sub) class must implement. An abstract class is declared using the abstract keyword.

##### **Example to Understand Abstract Class and Abstract Methods in C#:**

```C#
public abstract class AbsParent
{
    public void Add(int x, int y)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Addition of {x} and {y} is : {x + y}");
    }
    public void Sub(int x, int y)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Subtraction of {x} and {y} is : {x - y}");
    }
    public abstract void Mul(int x, int y);
    public abstract void Div(int x, int y);
}

```

##### **Can we create an instance of an abstract class in C#?

No. We cannot create an instance of an abstract class. Whether the abstract class contains any abstract methods or not, creating an instance of the abstract class is impossible.

##### **Why Abstract Class Cannot Be Instantiated in C#?**
```C#
using System;
namespace AbstractClassesAndMethods
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            AbsChild absChild = new AbsChild();
            absChild.Add(10, 5);
            absChild.Sub(10, 5);
            absChild.Mul(10, 5);
            absChild.Div(10, 2);

            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
   
    public abstract class AbsParent
    {
        public void Add(int x, int y)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Addition of {x} and {y} is : {x + y}");
        }
        public void Sub(int x, int y)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Subtraction of {x} and {y} is : {x - y}");
        }
        public abstract void Mul(int x, int y);
        public abstract void Div(int x, int y);
    }

    public class AbsChild : AbsParent
    {
        public override void Mul(int x, int y)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Multiplication of {x} and {y} is : {x * y}");
        }
        public override void Div(int x, int y)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Division of {x} and {y} is : {x / y}");
        }
    }
}

```
##### **Can we Create a Reference for the Abstract Class in C#?**

Yes, we can create a reference for the abstract class in C#. But we cannot create an instance of an abstract class in C#. For a better understanding, please have a look at the below image. Here, we created an instance of the child class,

![[word-image-1198-5.webp]]

```C#
using System;
namespace AbstractClassesAndMethods
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            //Creating Child class instance
            AbsChild absChild = new AbsChild();

            //Creating abstract class reference pointing to child class object
            AbsParent absParent = absChild;

            //Accessing methods using reference
            absParent.Add(10, 5);
            absParent.Sub(10, 5);
            absParent.Mul(10, 5);
            absParent.Div(10, 2);

            //You cannot call the Mod method using Parent reference as it is a pure child class method
            //absParent.Mod(100, 35);
            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
   
    public abstract class AbsParent
    {
        public void Add(int x, int y)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Addition of {x} and {y} is : {x + y}");
        }
        public void Sub(int x, int y)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Subtraction of {x} and {y} is : {x - y}");
        }
        public abstract void Mul(int x, int y);
        public abstract void Div(int x, int y);
    }

    public class AbsChild : AbsParent
    {
        public override void Mul(int x, int y)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Multiplication of {x} and {y} is : {x * y}");
        }
        public override void Div(int x, int y)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Division of {x} and {y} is : {x / y}");
        }
        public void Mod(int x, int y)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Modulos of {x} and {y} is : {x % y}");
        }
    }
}

```

##### **Summary of Abstract Class and Abstract Methods in C#**

1. A method that does not have a body is called an abstract method, and the class that is declared using the keyword abstract is called an abstract class. If a class contains an abstract method, it must be declared abstract.
2. An abstract class can contain both abstract and non-abstract methods. If a child class of an abstract class wants to consume any non-abstract methods of its parent, it should implement all abstract methods.
3. An abstract class is never usable in itself because we cannot create the object of an abstract class. The members of an abstract class can be consumed only by the child class of the abstract class.

##### **When to use the Abstract Method in C#?**

Abstract methods are usually declared where two or more subclasses are expected to fulfill a similar role in a different manner. You can also do the same thing using an interface also. But if we are using an abstract class means we can provide some common functionality that is going to be the same for all the child classes and this is not possible using the interface.

##### **What type of member can we define in an abstract class?**

We can define all static and non-static members including properties, fields, indexes, and also abstract methods.

![[word-image-30084-6.webp]]

##### **Will abstract class members be created when a subclass object is created?**

Yes**,** its non-static members get memory when its concrete sub-class object is created.

##### **How can we execute static and non-static concrete members of the abstract class?**

Static members can be executed directly by using the class name and its non-static members are executed by using its concrete sub-class or child class object. For a better understanding, please have a look at the following example.

```C#
using System;
namespace AbstractClassesAndMethods
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            //Calling Abstract Class Static Method using Class Name
            AbsParent.StaticMethod();

            AbsChild absChild = new AbsChild();
            //Calling the Abstract Class Concrete Method using Child Class Object
            absChild.NonStaticMethod();

            //calling the Abstract Method using Child Class Object
            absChild.AbstractMethod();

            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }

    public abstract class AbsParent
    {
        //Static Method
        public static void StaticMethod()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Static Method");
        }

        //Non-Static Method
        public void NonStaticMethod()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Non-Static Method");
        }

        //Abstract Method
        public abstract void AbstractMethod();
    }

    public class AbsChild : AbsParent
    {
        public override void AbstractMethod()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("AbstractMethod Implemented in Child Clas");
        }
    }
}

```

##### **Can we Declare an Abstract Method as Static in C#?**

No, we are not allowed to declare an abstract method as static. It leads to Compile Time Error. If the compiler allows us to declare it as static, it can be invoked directly using the class name which cannot be executed by CLR at runtime. Hence to restrict calling abstract methods compiler does not allow us to declare an abstract method as static.

```C#


```
![[can-we-declare-an-abstract-method-as-static-in-c.webp]]

##### **Can we Declare an Abstract Method as Sealed in C#?**

No, because it should be allowed to override in subclasses. If we will try to use sealed then we will get a Compile Time Error. For a better understanding, please have a look at the below image.

![[can-we-declare-an-abstract-method-as-sealed-in-c.webp]]

##### **Can we Declare an Abstract Method as Private in C#?**

No, because it should be inherited by subclasses. It leads to Compile Time Error: virtual or abstract members cannot be private. For a better understanding, please have a look at the below image.

![[can-we-declare-an-abstract-method-as-private-in-c-1.webp]]

##### **Can we Declare a Concrete Class as Abstract in C#?**

Yes, it is allowed. We can define an abstract class with only non-abstract methods. Defining a class as abstract is a way of preventing someone from instantiating a class that is supposed to be extended first. To ensure our class non-static members are only accessible via sub-class objects we should declare the concrete class as abstract.

```c#
using System;
namespace AbstractClassesAndMethods
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Example.Method1();

            //Compile Time Error: Cannot create an instance of the abstract class or interface 'Example'
            Example e = new Example();

            //Not possible
            e.Method2();
            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }

    public abstract class Example
    {
        public static void Method1()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Example Method1 method");
        }
        public void Method2()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Example Method2 method");
        }
    }
}

```

##### **Difference Between Abstract Methods and Method Overriding in C#:**

The concept of abstract methods will be nearly similar to the concept of method overriding in C#. Suppose, I have a class called A and, in this class, I have a virtual method called Display as follows.

```C#
public class A
{
    public virtual void Display()
    {
    }
}

```

Here, the Display method is a non-abstract method i.e. virtual method and now, this virtual method can be overridden in the Child class. Let us create a child class called B which is inherited from the above parent class i,e. A. Now, the child class can override the Display method of class A as follows. How we override the method by using the override modifier and this is called Re-Implementation. This is because the method is already implemented in class A and we are re-implementing it in class B.

```C#
public class B : A
{
    public override void Display() //Optional
    {
           //Re-Implementation
    }
}

```

**Note:** Re-implementing or overriding the virtual method of the parent class in the child class is optional.


Now, let us see the same example using abstract class and abstract method. Let us modify class A as follows. Here, we are declaring the class as an abstract, and the method as abstract by removing the virtual keyword as well as the method body.

```C#
public abstract class A
{
    public abstract void Display();
}

```


```C#
public class B : A
{
    public override void Display() //Mandatory
    {
        //Implementation
    }
}

```

**Note:** Implementation is mandatory in the child class because the parent class does not provide implementation, it is abstract in the parent class.


##### **Where do we need to define that Area method?**

We cannot define the area Method in the Shape class. Generally, what should come to Parent class means the things which are common for child classes. Now, we want a method that should return the area to an appropriate shape. Can we define that method in the Shape class? No. The reason is the formula to calculate the area varies from shape to shape. Because the formula varies from shape to shape, we cannot define that in the Parent class. This is the place where exactly abstract class and abstract method come into the picture.

```C#
public abstract class Shape
{
    public double Height;
    public double Width;
    public double Radius;
    public const float PI = 3.14f;
    public abstract double GetArea();
}

```
Now, the GetArea abstract method must and should be implemented by all the child classes of the parent Shape class. Why? Because this is a rule. Once a Parent class contains any abstract methods, those abstract methods must be implemented by the child classes. And it is mandatory.

```C#
public class Rectangle : Shape
{
    public Rectangle(double Height, double Width)
    {
        this.Height = Height;
        this.Width = Width;
    }

    public override double GetArea()
    {
        return Width * Height;
    }
}
public class Circle : Shape
{
    public Circle(double Radius)
    {
        this.Radius = Radius;
    }

    public override double GetArea()
    {
        return PI * Radius * Radius;
    }
}
public class Triangle : Shape
{
    public Triangle(double Height, double Width)
    {
        this.Height = Height;
        this.Width = Width;
    }

    public override double GetArea()
    {
        return (Width * Height) / 2;
    }
}
public class Cone : Shape
{
    public Cone(double Radius, double Height)
    {
        this.Radius = Radius;
        this.Height = Height;
    }

    public override double GetArea()
    {
        return PI * Radius * (Radius + Math.Sqrt(Height * Height + Radius * Radius));
    }
}

```

So, this is the process of how we are going to use abstract classes and abstract methods in our application development using the C# language.

##### **Example to Implement Abstract Classes and Abstract Methods in C# Application Development:**

```c#
using System;
namespace AbstractClassesAndMethods
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Rectangle rectangle = new Rectangle(10, 20);
            Console.WriteLine($"Area of Rectangle: {rectangle.GetArea()}");

            Triangle triangle = new Triangle(15, 25);
            Console.WriteLine($"Area of Triangle: {triangle.GetArea()}");

            Circle circle = new Circle(12);
            Console.WriteLine($"Area of Circle: {circle.GetArea()}");

            Cone cone = new Cone(5, 15);
            Console.WriteLine($"Area of Cone: {rectangle.GetArea()}");

            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
   
    public abstract class Shape
    {
        public double Height;
        public double Width;
        public double Radius;
        public  const float PI = 3.14f;
        public abstract double GetArea();
    }

    public class Rectangle : Shape
    {
        public Rectangle(double Height, double Width)
        {
           this.Height = Height;
            this.Width = Width;
        }

        public override double GetArea()
        {
            return Width * Height;
        }
    }
    public class Circle : Shape
    {
        public Circle(double Radius)
        {
            this.Radius = Radius;
        }

        public override double GetArea()
        {
            return PI * Radius * Radius;
        }
    }
    public class Triangle : Shape
    {
        public Triangle(double Height, double Width)
        {
            this.Height = Height;
            this.Width = Width;
        }

        public override double GetArea()
        {
            return (Width * Height)/ 2;
        }
    }
    public class Cone : Shape
    {
        public Cone(double Radius, double Height)
        {
            this.Radius = Radius;
            this.Height = Height;
        }

        public override double GetArea()
        {
            return PI * Radius * (Radius + Math.Sqrt(Height * Height + Radius * Radius));
        }
    }
}

```

##### **Abstract Class and Abstract Methods Example in C#:**

```C#
using System;
namespace AbstractClassMethods
{
    public abstract class Plan
    {
        protected abstract  double getRate();
        public void Calculation(int units)
        {
            double rate = getRate();
            Console.WriteLine($"Bill Amount For {units} Units is: Rs. {rate * units}");
        }
    }

    class CommercialPlan : Plan
    {
        protected override double getRate()
        {
           return 5.00;
        }
    }
    class DomesticlPlan : Plan
    {
        protected override double getRate()
        {
            return 2.50;
        }
    }

    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Plan p;
            Console.WriteLine("Commercial Plan");
            p = new CommercialPlan();
            p.Calculation(250);

            Console.WriteLine("Domesticl Plan");
            p = new DomesticlPlan();
            p.Calculation(150);
            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}

```
