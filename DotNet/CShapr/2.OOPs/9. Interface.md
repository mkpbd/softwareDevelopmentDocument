The Interface in C# is a **Fully Unimplemented Class** used for declaring a set of operations/methods of an object. So, we can define an interface as a pure abstract class, which allows us to define only abstract methods. The abstract method means a method without a body or implementation. It is used to achieve multiple inheritances, which the class can’t achieve. It is used to achieve full abstraction because it cannot have a method body.

In C#, an interface is a fundamental concept defining a contract or a set of rules a class must adhere to. It specifies a list of methods, properties, events, or indexers a class implementing the interface must provide. Interfaces allow you to define a common set of functionality that multiple classes can share, promoting code reusability and ensuring a consistent structure for related classes.


##### **Differences Between Concrete Class, Abstract Class, and Interface in C#:**

A Concrete Class can contain only the methods that contain the method body. Do we have a method without the body? Yes, we have methods without a body, called abstract methods. So, we can say class contains a method with a method body, or you can say non-abstract methods. Abstract class contains abstract and non-abstract methods, and the interface contains only abstract methods.

1. **Class:** Contains only the Non-Abstract Methods (Methods with Method Body).
2. **Abstract Class:** Contains both Non-Abstract Methods (Methods with Method Body) and Abstract Methods (Methods without Method Body).
3. **Interface:** Contain only Abstract Methods (Methods without Method Body).

**Note:** Every abstract method of an interface should be implemented by the child class of the interface without fail (Mandatory).

Now, just like a class has another class as a Parent, a class can also have an Interface as a Parent. If a class has an interface as a Parent, the class is responsible for implementing all the abstract methods of the interface.

![[word-image-1188-2.webp]]

Simply speaking, the Parent Interface imposes restrictions on the Child Classes. **What restrictions?** The restrictions are to implement each and every method of the interface under the child class.

##### **How to Define an Interface in C#?**

The way we define a class in the same way we need to define an interface in C#. In a class declaration, we need to use the class keyword, whereas in an interface declaration, we need to use the interface keyword. Moreover, in an interface, we can only declare abstract members. F

![[word-image-1188-3.webp]]

```C#
interface ITestInterface
{
    //Abstract Member Declarations
}
```

```C#
interface ITestInterface
{
    //By default, the following method is public and abstract
    void Add(int num1, int num2);
}

```

**Point 3:** You need to remember that we cannot declare fields/variables, constructors, and destructors in an interface in C#

![[word-image-1188-4.webp]]

##### **What are the Members we can and can’t define in an interface in C#?**

An interface can contain

1. **Abstract methods**
2. **Properties**
3. **Indexes**
4. **Events**

An interface cannot contain

1. **Non-abstract functions**
2. **Data fields**
3. **Constructors**
4. **Destructors**

**Point 4:** The fourth point you need to remember is that an interface can inherit from another interface in C# just like a class inherits from another.

For a better understanding, please have a look at the below code. Here, we have two interfaces, i.e., Interface1 and Interface2. Interface2 is inherited from Interface1, and now interface2 has two abstract methods,

![[word-image-1188-5.webp]]

**Point 5:** The fifth point that you need to remember is every member of an interface should be implemented under the child class without fail (mandatory), but while implementing, we aren’t required to use the override modifier just like we have done in the case of an abstract class.

```c#
interface ITestInterface1
{
    void Add(int num1, int num2);
}
interface ITestInterface2 : ITestInterface1
{
    void Sub(int num1, int num2);
}

public class ImplementationClass1 : ITestInterface1
{
    //Implement only the Add method
    public void Add(int num1, int num2)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Sum of {num1} and {num2} is {num1 + num2}");
    }
}

public class ImplementationClass2 : ITestInterface2
{
    //Implement Both Add and Sub method
    public void Add(int num1, int num2)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Sum of {num1} and {num2} is {num1 + num2}");
    }

    public void Sub(int num1, int num2)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Divison of {num1} and {num2} is {num1 - num2}");
    }
}

```

##### **Example to Understand Interface in C#:**

```c#
using System;
namespace AbstractClassMethods
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main()
        {
            ImplementationClass1 obj1 = new ImplementationClass1();
            //Using obj1 we can only call Add method
            obj1.Add(10, 20);
            //We cannot call Sub method
            //obj1.Sub(100, 20);

            ImplementationClass2 obj2 = new ImplementationClass2();
            //Using obj2 we can call both Add and Sub method
            obj2.Add(10, 20);
            obj2.Sub(100, 20);

            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
    
    interface ITestInterface1
    {
        void Add(int num1, int num2);
    }
    interface ITestInterface2 : ITestInterface1
    {
        void Sub(int num1, int num2);
    }

    public class ImplementationClass1 : ITestInterface1
    {
        //Implement only the Add method
        public void Add(int num1, int num2)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Sum of {num1} and {num2} is {num1 + num2}");
        }
    }

    public class ImplementationClass2 : ITestInterface2
    {
        //Implement Both Add and Sub method
        public void Add(int num1, int num2)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Sum of {num1} and {num2} is {num1 + num2}");
        }

        public void Sub(int num1, int num2)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Divison of {num1} and {num2} is {num1 - num2}");
        }
    }
}

```

**Point 6:** We cannot create an instance of an interface, but we can create a reference of an interface. The interface reference is going to hold the child class instance. We can only invoke the methods declared in the interface using the interface reference.

##### **Example to Understand Interface Reference in C#:**

```c#
using System;
namespace AbstractClassMethods
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main()
        {
            //Creating Reference of an Interface point to the 
            //child class instance
            ITestInterface1 obj = new ImplementationClass();

            //Add method signature declared in ITestInterface1, so we can
            //Invoke the Add method
            obj.Add(10, 20);

            //Sub method signature is not declared in ITestInterface1, 
            //so, we cannot Invoke the Sub method
            //obj.Sub(100, 20);
            
            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
    
    interface ITestInterface1
    {
        void Add(int num1, int num2);
    }
    
    public class ImplementationClass : ITestInterface1
    {
        //Interface Method Implementation
        public void Add(int num1, int num2)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Sum of {num1} and {num2} is {num1 + num2}");
        }

        //This method purely belongs to ImplementationClass
        public void Sub(int num1, int num2)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Divison of {num1} and {num2} is {num1 - num2}");
        }
    }
}

```

##### **Explicit Interface Implementation in C#**

When each interface method is implemented separately under the child class by providing the method name and the interface name, it is called Explicit Interface Implementation. But in this case, while calling the method, we should compulsorily use the interface reference created using the object of a class or typecast the object to the appropriate interface type.

![[word-image-1188-8.webp]]

##### **Explicit Interface Implementation Example in C#**

```C#
using System;
namespace AbstractClassMethods
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main()
        {
            ImplementationClass obj1 = new ImplementationClass();
            //Using obj1 we can call the Add method directly because
            //It is implemented using public access specifier
            obj1.Add(10, 20);

            //We need to typecast obj1 to ITestInterface1 to call the Sub
            //method because Sub method is implemented using Interface name
            ((ITestInterface1)obj1).Sub(100, 20);

            //We can call the method directly using the interface reference
            //Typecasting is not required in this case
            ITestInterface1 obj2 = new ImplementationClass();
            obj2.Add(200, 50);
            obj2.Sub(200, 50);

            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
    
    interface ITestInterface1
    {
        void Add(int num1, int num2);
        void Sub(int num1, int num2);
    }
    
    public class ImplementationClass : ITestInterface1
    {
        //Interface Method Implementation
        public void Add(int num1, int num2)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Sum of {num1} and {num2} is {num1 + num2}");
        }

        //This method purely belongs to ImplementationClass
        void ITestInterface1.Sub(int num1, int num2)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Divison of {num1} and {num2} is {num1 - num2}");
        }
    }
}

```

##### **When to use Interface in C#?**

Interfaces in C# are a powerful feature that defines contracts or specifications that classes must adhere to. You should consider using interfaces in the following scenarios:

- **Defining a Common Contract:** To ensure that multiple classes provide a common set of methods, properties, events, or indexers, you can create an interface to define that contract. This is useful in situations where different classes need to exhibit similar behavior but may have different implementations.
- **Implementing Multiple Inheritance:** C# does not support multiple inheritance for classes (a class cannot inherit from multiple classes) but supports multiple interface implementation. If you need a class to inherit behavior or structure from multiple sources, you can use interfaces to achieve this. This allows you to share code among different classes without the complexities of multiple-class inheritance.
- **Enforcing a Specific Structure:** When you want to enforce a specific structure or a particular set of methods and properties for classes within your application or library, interfaces can help ensure that classes conform to that structure.
- **Implementing Polymorphism:** Interfaces are essential for achieving polymorphism in C#. When different classes implement the same interface, you can treat objects of these classes uniformly, making it easier to work with various objects in a polymorphic way. This is useful in scenarios where you want to work with objects at a higher level of abstraction.
- **Testing and Mocking:** Interfaces are valuable in unit testing scenarios. You can create interfaces for external dependencies or services and then create mock implementations of those interfaces for testing purposes. This enables you to isolate and test individual components of your codebase more effectively.
- **Collaboration in Teams:** Interfaces can help teams collaborate more effectively on large codebases. By defining clear interfaces, developers can work independently on different parts of a project, knowing that their code will integrate seamlessly as long as it adheres to the specified interfaces.
- **Code Reusability:** Interfaces promote code reusability. You can create a set of interfaces representing common functionalities in your application, and different classes can implement these interfaces. This way, you can reuse code across multiple classes without duplicating it.
- **Dependency Injection:** When using dependency injection, interfaces often define dependencies that can be injected into classes. This helps achieve loose coupling and makes it easier to switch implementations at runtime.

##### **Real-Time Example of Interface in C#:**

If you are attending any interviews, then the interviewer might ask you this question to you what is the use of the interface in the real-time applications or he might be asked you where you have used the interface in your project?

Let us understand the answer with one real-time example. Suppose, you are going to develop an application for a Bank. And we know nowadays, we can open different types of bank accounts, for example, Saving Accounts, Current Accounts, Demat Accounts, etc. And we already know the features and services of all these different types of bank Accounts.


Now, the question is how we can implement this application. So, we are going to develop one Bank application where we will allow the user to create the following accounts.

1. **Saving Account**
2. **Current Account**

And in each account, we are going to provide the following services.

1. **DepositAmount**
2. **WithdrawAmount**
3. **CheckBalance**

So, how can implement the above means, we will create one interface, let’s say IBankAccount by declaring above three services as follows:


```C#
namespace BankApplication
{
    interface IBankAccount
    {
        bool DepositAmount(decimal amount);
        bool WithdrawAmount(decimal amount);
        decimal CheckBalance();
    }
} 

```


##### **Saving Account:**

Create a class file with the name SavingAccount.cs and then copy and paste the following code. Here, you can see that we are creating three private variables. The Balance variable is used to hold the account balance of the user, PerDayWithdrawLimit is sued to restrict the user withdrawal i.e. we are setting 10000 per day and the TodayWithdrawal variable is used to hold the current day withdrawal amount. Our class is implementing the IBankAccount interface and providing the implementation for all three abstract methods that are defined inside the IBankAccount interface.

1. **DepositAmount:** This method takes the amount to be deposited and the logic is very straightforward. Whatever amount we are getting, we are just adding the amount with the Balance private variable.
2. **WithdrawAmount**: In this method, we have written three pieces of logic. First, we are checking whether the withdrawal amount is less than the available balance or not. Second, we are checking whether the withdrawal amount exceeds the per-day withdrawal limit or not. In these two conditions are satisfied, then we are withdrawing the amount and returning true to the user.
3. **CheckBalance:** This method implementation is very straightforward; whatever value we have in the Balance variable we are simply returning.

```C#
using System;
namespace BankApplication
{
    public class SavingAccount : IBankAccount
    {
        private decimal Balance = 0;
        private readonly decimal PerDayWithdrawLimit = 10000;
        private decimal TodayWithdrawal = 0;

        public bool DepositAmount(decimal Amount)
        {
            Balance = Balance + Amount;
            Console.WriteLine($"You have Deposited: {Amount}");
            Console.WriteLine($"Your Account Balance: {Balance}");
            return true;
        }

        //Maximum Withdrawal Per Day: 10000
        public bool WithdrawAmount(decimal Amount)
        {
            if (Balance < Amount)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("You have Insufficient balance!");
                return false;
            }
            else if (TodayWithdrawal + Amount > PerDayWithdrawLimit)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Withdrawal attempt failed!");
                return false;
            }
            else
            {
                Balance = Balance - Amount;
                TodayWithdrawal = TodayWithdrawal + Amount;
                Console.WriteLine($"You have Successfully Withdraw: {Amount}");
                Console.WriteLine($"Your Account Balance: {Balance}");
                return true;
            }
        }
        public decimal CheckBalance()
        {
            return Balance;
        }
    }
}

```

##### **Current Account:**

Next, create a class file with the name CurrentAccount.cs and then copy and paste the following code. Here, you can see that we are creating one private variable i.e. Balance to hold the account balance of the user. Here, we are not creating PerDayWithdrawLimit and TodayWithdrawal variables as there is no limit on the amount to be withdrawn from a current account. Then our class CuurentAccount is implementing the IBankAccount interface and provides the implementation for all three abstract methods that are defined inside the IBankAccount interface.

1. **DepositAmount:** This method takes the amount to be deposited and the logic is the same as the SavingAccount. Whatever amount the user is sending, we are just adding the amount with the Balance private variable.
2. **WithdrawAmount**: In this method, first, we are checking whether the withdrawal amount is less than the available balance or not. If the withdrawal amount is less than the account balance, then we are withdrawing the amount and returning true to the user.
3. **CheckBalance:** This method implementation is the same as SavingAccount; whatever value we have in the Balance variable that we are simply returning.

```C#
using System;
namespace BankApplication
{
    public class CurrentAccount : IBankAccount
    {
        private decimal Balance = 0;
        
        public bool DepositAmount(decimal Amount)
        {
            Balance = Balance + Amount;
            Console.WriteLine($"You have Deposited: {Amount}");
            Console.WriteLine($"Your Account Balance: {Balance}");
            return true;
        }

        public bool WithdrawAmount(decimal Amount)
        {
            if (Balance < Amount)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("You have Insufficient balance!");
                return false;
            }
            else
            {
                Balance = Balance - Amount;
                Console.WriteLine($"You have Successfully Withdraw: {Amount}");
                Console.WriteLine($"Your Account Balance: {Balance}");
                return true;
            }
        }
        public decimal CheckBalance()
        {
            return Balance;
        }
    }
}

```

```C#
using System;
namespace BankApplication
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Saving Account:");
            IBankAccount savingAccount = new SavingAccount();
            savingAccount.DepositAmount(2000);
            savingAccount.DepositAmount(1000);
            savingAccount.WithdrawAmount(1500);
            savingAccount.WithdrawAmount(5000);
            Console.WriteLine($"Saving Account Balanace: {savingAccount.CheckBalance()}");

            Console.WriteLine("\nCurrent Account:");
            IBankAccount currentAccount = new CurrentAccount();
            currentAccount.DepositAmount(500);
            currentAccount.DepositAmount(1500);
            currentAccount.WithdrawAmount(2600);
            currentAccount.WithdrawAmount(1000);
            Console.WriteLine($"Current Account Balanace: {currentAccount.CheckBalance()}");
            Console.ReadLine();
        }
    }
}

```

        Console.WriteLine("Test Method is Implemented in Child Class");
    }

{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            MultipleInheritanceTest obj = new MultipleInheritanceTest();
            obj.Test();
            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }

    public interface Interface1
    {
        void Test();
    }
    public interface Interface2
    {

        public void Test()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Test Method is Implemented in Child Class");
        }
    }
}

```

##### **How to Implement Each Interfaces Method Separately in C#?**
```C#
using System;
namespace MultipleInheritance
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            MultipleInheritanceTest obj = new MultipleInheritanceTest();
            obj.Test();
            //You cannot call the Show method using obj
            //obj.Show();

            //Using Interface Reference call the Show method
            Interface1 i1 = obj;
            i1.Show();

            //Typecase the object to interface type and call the show method
            ((Interface2)obj).Show();

            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }

    public interface Interface1
    {
        void Test();
        void Show();
    }
    public interface Interface2
    {
        void Test();
        void Show();
    }

    public class MultipleInheritanceTest : Interface1, Interface2
    {
        //Normal Implementation
        public void Test()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Test Method is Implemented in Child Class");
        }

        //Explicit Interface Implementation
        void Interface1.Show()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Interface1 Show Method is Implemented in Child Class");
        }

        //Explicit Interface Implementation
        void Interface2.Show()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Interface2 Show Method is Implemented in Child Class");
        }
    }
}

```

##### **When do you choose interface over an abstract class or vice versa in C#?**

If we want some implementation that will be the same for all the derived classes, then it is better to go for an abstract class instead of an interface. With the interface, we can move our implementation to any class that implements the interface. With the abstract class, we can share the implementation for all the derived classes in one central place, and thus avoid code duplication in the derived classes.

##### **Can an interface inherit from another interface in C#?**

Yes, an interface can inherit from another interface in C#. It is possible for a class to inherit an interface multiple times, through base classes or interfaces it inherits. In this case, the class can only implement the interface one time, if it is declared as part of the new class. If the inherited interface is not declared as part of the new class, its implementation is provided by the base class that declared it. It is possible for a base class to implement interface members using virtual members; in that case, the class inheriting the interface can change the interface behavior by overriding the virtual members.

##### **Can you create an instance of an interface in C#?**

No, you cannot create an instance of an interface in C#. But you can create a reference variable of an interface.

##### **If a class inherits an interface, what are the 2 options available for that class?**

**Option 1:** Provide Implementation for all the members inherited from the interface. For a better understanding
