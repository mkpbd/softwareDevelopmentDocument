**Algorithm:** An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure for solving a computational problem. It is a process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations.

**Program:** A program is a step-by-step machine instruction used for solving any problem or computational task.

##### **Difference between Algorithm and Program**

Programs have been written recently but Algorithms have appeared for centuries. As a common practice, mathematicians or scientists have been devising procedures for solving computational problems. Those working on problems were giving solutions in form of step-by-step procedures known as algorithms. Now we want that same procedure must be followed by machines so we are writing programs.


##### **What is Pseudocode?**

Pseudocode is an artificial and informal language that helps programmers in developing algorithms. It is basically a “text-based” detail (algorithmic) design tool.

##### **What is a Flowchart?**

A flowchart is used for showing the flow of control in a program and the sequence of steps involved in a hierarchical manner. It is basically a diagrammatic representation of an algorithm, workflow, or process.

##### **Use of Flowchart**

Flowcharts were highly used at the times of Monolithic Programming. Then later on when the concept of Procedural Programming came into practice, the usage of flowcharts was a little reduced.

##### **Steps in the flowchart:**

Usually, when we are using a flow chart for the program, it consists of three steps:

1. Input
2. Process
3. Output
##### **Elements of Flowchart:**

Now let us look at the elements of the flow chart. The following image shows the different elements of a flowchart.

**Terminal**: The oval symbol indicates Start, Stop and Halt in a program’s logic flow. A pause/halt is generally used in programming logic under some error conditions. The terminal is the first and last symbol in the flowchart.

**Input/Output**: A parallelogram denotes any function of input/output type. Program instructions that take input from input devices and display output on output devices are indicated with a parallelogram in a flowchart.

**Processing**: A box represents arithmetic instructions. All arithmetic processes such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are indicated by the action/process symbol.

**Decision:** Diamond-shaped symbol represents a decision point. Decision-based operations such as Yes/No, question, or True/False are indicated by diamond shape in the flowchart.

**Flow lines**: Flow lines indicate the exact sequence in which instructions are executed. Arrows represent the direction of flow of control and the relationship among different symbols of the flowchart.

**Step 1**: Start.

**Step 2**: Declare variables Number1 and Number2.

**Step 3**: Read values Number1 and Number2.

**Step 4**: Add Number1 and Number2 and store the result in Sum. (Sum = Number1 + Number2).

**Step 5**: Display Sum.

**Step 6**: Stop.
