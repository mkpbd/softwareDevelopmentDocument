##### **Basic Structure of the C# Program**

Now, let’s understand the Basic Structure of the C# Program using a Console Application.

##### **Step2**

The next step is to choose the project type as a **Console Application**. Type Console in the search bar and you will see different types of console applications using C#, VB, and F# Programming Languages and using both .NET Framework and .NET Core / .NET. Here, I am selecting **Console App (.NET Framework)** using **C# Language** and then clicking on the **Next** button as shown in the below image.

##### **Step3**

![[word-image-27425-6-1.webp]]

A project called **MYFirstProject** will be created in Visual Studio. This project will contain all the necessary required files (Properties, References, App.Config files) to run the Console application. The Main program called **Program.cs** is the default code file that is created when a new console application is created in Visual Studio it contains the Main method by default and from that Main method our application is going to start its execution, but if you want you can also change this default behavior. So, if you look at the **Program.cs** class file, then you will see the following code.

##### **Step4**

Now let’s write our code which will be used to display the message “**Welcome to C#.NET**” in the console window. To do so, modify the Main method of the Program class as shown in the below code.

```c#
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

namespace MyFirstProject
{
    internal class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Welcome to C#.NET");
            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
} 

```


###### **Step5**

The next step is to run the .NET Application. To run any program in Visual Studio, you just need to click on the Start button or you can press **CTRL+F5** as shown in the below image.

## **Methods and Properties of Console Class in C#**


##### **What is Console Class in C#?**

![[word-image-27425-1-1.webp]]

In order to implement the user interface in console applications, Microsoft provided us with a class called Console. The Console class is available in the System namespace. This Console class provides some methods and properties using which we can implement the user interface in a console application.

In order words, if we want to work with the console window either for taking user input or to show the output, we are provided with the Console in C#.

According to Microsoft documentation the Console class represents the standard input, output, and error streams for console applications and this class cannot be inherited because it is a static class i.e. declared as static as shown in the below image.


##### **Properties of Console Class in C#:**

There are many properties available in the Console class. Some of them are as follows:

1. **Title**: It gets or sets the title to display in the console title bar. It returns the string to be displayed in the title bar of the console. The maximum length of the title string is 24500 characters.
2. **BackgroundColor**: It gets or sets the background color of the console. It returns a value that specifies the background color of the console; that is, the color that appears behind each character. The default is black.
3. **ForegroundColor**: It gets or sets the foreground color of the console. It returns a ConsoleColor that specifies the foreground color of the console; that is, the color of each character that is displayed. The default is gray.
4. **CursorSize**: It gets or sets the height of the cursor within a character cell. It returns the size of the cursor expressed as a percentage of the height of a character cell. The property value ranges from 1 to 100.

##### **Methods of Console Class in C#:**

There are many methods available in the Console class. Some of them are as follows:

1. **Clear():** It is used to clear the console buffer and corresponding console window of display information. In simple words, it is used to clear the screen.
2. **Beep():** This method plays the sound of a beep through the console speaker. That means it plays a beep sound using a PC speaker at runtime.
3. **ResetColor():** This method is used to set the foreground and background console colors to their defaults.
4. **Write(“string”):** This method is used to write the specified string value to the standard output stream.
5. **WriteLine(“string”):** This method is used to write the specified string value, followed by the current line terminator, to the standard output stream. That means this method same as the write method but automatically moves the cursor to the next line after printing the message.
6. **Write(variable):** This method is used to write the value of the given variable to the standard output stream.
7. **WriteLine(variable):** This method is used to write the value of the given variable to the standard output stream along with moving the cursor to the next line after printing the value of the variable.
8. **Read():** This method read a single character from the keyboard and returns its ASCII value. The Datatype should be int as it returns the ASCII value.
9. **ReadLine():** This method reads a string value from the keyboard and returns the entered value only. As it returns the entered string value so the DataType is going to be a string.
10. **ReadKey():**  This method reads a single character from the keyboard and returns that character information like what key has been entered, and what its corresponding ASCII value is. The Datatype should be ConsoleKeyInfo which contains the entered key information

##### **Example to show the use of the Write and WriteLine method in C#:**

The following example code is self-explained, so please go through the comment lines.


```C#
//Program to show the use of WriteLine and Write Method
//First Import the System namespace as the
//Console class belongs to System namespace
using System;
namespace MyFirstProject
{
    internal class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            //We can access WriteLine and Write method using class name
            //as these methods are static

            //WriteLine Method Print the value and move the cursor to the next line
            Console.WriteLine("Hello");
            //Write Method Print the value and stay in the same line
            Console.Write("HI ");
            //Write Method Print the value and stay in the same line
            Console.Write("Bye ");
            //WriteLine Method Print the value and move the cursor to the next line
            Console.WriteLine("Welcome");
            //Write Method Print the value and stay in the same line
            Console.Write("C#.NET ");
            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}

```
