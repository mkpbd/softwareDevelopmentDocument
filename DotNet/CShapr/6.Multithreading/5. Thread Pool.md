##### **The Request Life cycle of a Thread in C# with Example.**

Let us understand the life cycle of a thread in C#. In order to understand this, please have a look at the following image. When the .NET framework receives a request (the request can be a method call or function call from any kind of application). To handle that request, a thread object is created. When the thread object is created some resources are allocated to that thread object such as memory. After then the task is executed and once the task is completed then the garbage collector removes that thread object to free up memory allocation. This is the life cycle of a thread in C#.

![[word-image-75.webp]]

These steps are going to be repeated again and again for each request that comes in a multithread application. That means every time a new thread object is created, it gets allocated in the memory. If there are many requests then there will be many thread objects and if there are many thread objects then there will be a load on the memory which slows down your application.

There is great room for performance improvements. The Thread object is created, resources are allocated, the task is executed, and then it should not go for garbage collection, instead of how about taking the thread object and putting it into a pool as shown in the below image? This is where thread pooling comes into the picture.

![[DotNet/CShapr/images/word-image-76.webp]]
##### **Thread Pool in C#:**

The Thread pool in C# is nothing but a collection of threads that can be reused to perform a number of tasks in the background. Now when a request comes, then it directly goes to the thread pool and checks whether there are any free threads available or not. If available, then it takes the thread object from the thread pool and executes the task as shown in the below image.


![[DotNet/CShapr/images/word-image-77.webp]]

Once the thread completes its task then it is again sent back to the thread pool so that it can reuse. This reusability avoids an application to create a number of threads and this enables less memory consumption.

##### **How to use Thread Pool in C#?**

Let us see a simple example to understand how to use Thread Pooling in C#. Once you understand how to use thread pooling, then we will see the performance benchmark between the normal thread object and the thread pool thread object.

###### **Step1:**

In order to implement thread pooling in C#, first, we need to import the Threading namespace as ThreadPool class belongs to this Threading namespace as shown below.

**using System.Threading;**

###### **Step2:**

Once you import the Threading namespace, then you need to use the **ThreadPool** class, and using this class you need to call the **QueueUserWorkItem** static method. And, if you go to the definition of the **QueueUserWorkItem** method, then you will see that this method takes one parameter of the type **WaitCallback** object. While creating the object of the **WaitCallback** class, you need to pass the method name that you want to execute as shown below.

**ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem(new WaitCallback(MyMethod));**

Here, the **QueueUserWorkItem** method Queues the function for execution and that function executes when a thread becomes available from the thread pool. If no thread is available then it will wait until one thread gets freed. Here MyMethod is the method that we want to execute by a thread pool thread.

##### **Complete Example Code to Understand Thread Pooling in C#**

As you can see in the below code, here, we create one method that is MyMethod and as part of that method, we simply print the thread id, whether the thread is a background thread or not, and whether it is from a thread pool or not. And we want to execute this method 10 times using the thread pool threads. So, here we use a simple for each loop and use the ThreadPool class and call that method.

```C#
using System;
using System.Threading;

namespace ThreadPoolApplication
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
            {
                ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem(new WaitCallback(MyMethod));
            }
            Console.Read();
        }

        public static void MyMethod(object obj)
        {
            Thread thread = Thread.CurrentThread;
            string message = $"Background: {thread.IsBackground}, Thread Pool: {thread.IsThreadPoolThread}, Thread ID: {thread.ManagedThreadId}";
            Console.WriteLine(message);
        }
    }
}

```

Now, let us see the same example using the normal threads. Please modify the code as follows. Here, instead of using ThreadPool, we are using the Thread class to create the threads and invoke the methods.

```C#
using System;
using System.Threading;

namespace ThreadPoolApplication
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
            {
                Thread thread = new Thread(MyMethod)
                {
                    Name = "Thread" + i
                };
                thread.Start();
            }
            Console.Read();
        }

        public static void MyMethod(object obj)
        {
            Thread thread = Thread.CurrentThread;
            string message = $"Background: {thread.IsBackground}, Thread Pool: {thread.IsThreadPoolThread}, Thread ID: {thread.ManagedThreadId}";
            Console.WriteLine(message);
        }
    }
}

```

##### **Performance testing using and without using Thread Pool in C# with Example:**

Let us see an example to understand the performance benchmark. Here, we will compare how much time the thread object takes and how much time the thread pool thread takes to do the same task i.e. to execute the same methods.

In order to do this, what we are going to do is, we will create a method called **Test** as shown below. This method takes an input parameter of the type object and as part of that Test method, we are doing nothing that means an empty method.

![[DotNet/CShapr/images/word-image-79.webp]]

Then we will create two methods such as **MethodWithThread** and **MethodWithThreadPool** and inside these two methods, we will create one for loop which will execute 10 times. Within for loop, we are going to call the Test as shown below. As you can see, the **MethodWithThread** method uses the Thread object to call the Test method while the **MethodWithThreadPool** method uses the ThreadPool object to call the Test method.
![[DotNet/CShapr/images/word-image-80.webp]]


Now we need to call the above two methods (**MethodWithThread** and **MethodWithThreadPool**) from the main method. As we are going to test the performance benchmark, we are going to call these two methods between the stopwatch start and end as shown below. The Stopwatch class is available in **System.Diagnostics** namespace. The for loop within the Main method is for warm-up. This is because when we run the code for the first time, compilation happens and compilation takes some time and we don’t want to measure that.

![[word-image-81.webp]]

```C#
using System;
using System.Diagnostics;
using System.Threading;

namespace ThreadPoolApplication
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            //Warmup Code start
            for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
            {
                MethodWithThread();
                MethodWithThreadPool();
            }
            //Warmup Code start
            Stopwatch stopwatch = new Stopwatch();

            Console.WriteLine("Execution using Thread");
            stopwatch.Start();
            MethodWithThread();
            stopwatch.Stop();
            Console.WriteLine("Time consumed by MethodWithThread is : " +
                                 stopwatch.ElapsedTicks.ToString());
            
            stopwatch.Reset();

            Console.WriteLine("Execution using Thread Pool");
            stopwatch.Start();
            MethodWithThreadPool();
            stopwatch.Stop();
            Console.WriteLine("Time consumed by MethodWithThreadPool is : " +
                                 stopwatch.ElapsedTicks.ToString());
            
            Console.Read();
        }

        public static void MethodWithThread()
        {
            for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
            {
                Thread thread = new Thread(Test);
                thread.Start();
            }
        }

        public static void MethodWithThreadPool()
        {
            for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
            {
                ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem(new WaitCallback(Test));
            }           
        }

        public static void Test(object obj)
        {
        }       
    }
}

```

As you can see in the above output, the Time consumed by MethodWithThread is 272588 and the Time consumed by MethodWithThreadPool is 692. If you observe there is a vast time difference between these two.

So it proves that the thread pool gives better performance as compared to the thread class object. If there are need to create one or two threads then you need to use the Thread class object while if there is a need to create more than 5 threads then you need to go for the thread pool class in a multithreaded environment.

##### **Types of Threads in C#**

Threading is one of the most important concepts and as a developer, we all need to understand this concept because in most real-time applications we use threading. In C#, by default, the execution of an application starts with a thread which is called the main thread which is automatically run by the CLR and the Operating System.

From the main thread, we can also create other threads for doing the desired tasks simultaneously or concurrently in the application. In C#, we can create two types of threads. They are as follows.

1. **Foreground Thread**
2. **Background Thread**

##### **Foreground Thread in C#:**

Foreground threads are those threads that keep running even after the main application exits or quits. That means if the Main thread leaves the application, then still the foreground threads are running to complete their assigned task. So, the foreground threads in C# do not care whether the main thread is alive or not, it completes only when it finishes its assigned work. That means the life of a foreground thread in C# does not depend upon the main thread. The foreground thread has the ability to prevent the current application from terminating. The CLR will not shut down the application until all the Foreground Threads have finished their assigned work. The main thread is a foreground thread.

##### **Background Thread in C#:**

Background Threads are those threads that will quit if our main application quits. Or in simple words, we can say that the life of the background thread will depend upon the life of the main thread. In short, if our main application quits, then the background threads will also quit. Background threads are viewed by the CLR and if all foreground threads have terminated, then all the background threads are automatically stopped when the application quits.

**Note:** By default, when we created a thread in C#, it is a Foreground thread.

##### **How to Make a Thread as Background Thread in C#?**

As we already discussed, in C#, the thread is created and managed by the Thread class. The Thread class provides a property called IsBackground to check whether the given thread is running in the background or in the foreground. If the value of IsBackground property is set to true, then the thread is a background thread i.e. running in the background. Or if the value of IsBackground is set to false, then the thread is a foreground thread i.e. running in the foreground.

1. **IsBackground {get; set;}:** This property is used to get or set a value indicating whether or not a thread is a background thread. It returns true if this thread is or is to become a background thread; otherwise, false. It throws ThreadStateException if the thread is dead.

By default, when we create a thread in C# by using the Thread class, the IsBackground property is false, and if you want to make a background thread in your program, then you need to set the value of IsBackground property of the thread to true.

##### **Example to Understand Foreground Thread in C#:**

By default when we created a thread in C#, it is a Foreground Thread. As we discussed Foreground Threads are the threads that keep running even when the main application or main thread quits. Let us understand this with an example.

```C#
using System;
using System.Threading;

namespace MultithreadingDemo
{
    public class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            // A thread created here to run Method1 Parallely
            Thread thread1 = new Thread(Method1);
            Console.WriteLine($"Thread1 is a Background thread:  {thread1.IsBackground}");
            thread1.Start();

            //The control will come here and will exit 
            //the main thread or main application
            Console.WriteLine("Main Thread Exited");
        }

        // Static method
        static void Method1()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Method1 Started");
            for (int i = 0; i <= 5; i++)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Method1 is in Progress!!");
                Thread.Sleep(1000);
            }
            Console.WriteLine("Method1 Exited");
            Console.WriteLine("Press any key to Exit.");
            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}

```

As you can see in the above output, after the main thread or main method completes its execution, still the Foreground Thread is running. So, this proves that Foreground threads keep running and complete their tasks even after the application exits or quits i.e. even after the main thread quits.

##### **Example to Understand Background Thread in C#:**

By default when we created a thread in C#, it is a Foreground Thread. And, if you want to make a thread as a background thread, then you need to set the IsBackground property of the thread object to true. Background Threads are the threads that will quit if our main thread quits i.e. if all the foreground threads quit, then automatically the background thread quits. Let us understand this with an example. We are rewriting the previous example and here we simply set the IsBackground property to true of the thread object.

```c#
using System;
using System.Threading;

namespace MultithreadingDemo
{
    public class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            // A thread created here to run Method1 Parallely
            Thread thread1 = new Thread(Method1)
            {
                //Thread becomes background thread
                IsBackground = true
            };
            
            Console.WriteLine($"Thread1 is a Background thread:  {thread1.IsBackground}");
            thread1.Start();

            //The control will come here and will exit 
            //the main thread or main application
            Console.WriteLine("Main Thread Exited");

            //As the Main thread (i.e. foreground thread exits the application)
            //Automatically, the background thread quits the application
        }

        // Static method
        static void Method1()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Method1 Started");
            for (int i = 0; i <= 5; i++)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Method1 is in Progress!!");
                Thread.Sleep(1000);
            }
            Console.WriteLine("Method1 Exited");
            Console.WriteLine("Press any key to Exit.");
            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}
```

##### **Multiple Foreground Threads and one Background Thread in C#**

In the below example, the main thread is by default a foreground thread and the main thread creates a thread1 object to call Method1. Here, thread1 is also a foreground thread. Then from Method1, we created a foreground thread to call Method2. Here, once all the foreground threads i.e. Main thread and thread1 quit, then automatically the background thread i.e. thread2 quits the application without completing its task (sometimes the task might be completed).

```C#
using System;
using System.Threading;

namespace MultithreadingDemo
{
    public class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            // A thread created here to run Method1 Parallely
            Thread thread1 = new Thread(Method1)
            {
            };

            Console.WriteLine($"Thread1 is a Background thread:  {thread1.IsBackground}");
            thread1.Start();

            //The control will come here and will exit 
            //the main thread or main application
            Console.WriteLine("Main Thread Exited");

            //As the Main thread (i.e. foreground thread exits the application)
            //Automatically, the background thread quits the application
        }

        // Static method
        static void Method1()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Method1 Started");
            Thread thread2 = new Thread(Method2)
            {
                IsBackground = true
            };
            thread2.Start();
            Thread.Sleep(3000);
            Console.WriteLine("Method1 Exited");
        }

        // Static method
        static void Method2()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Method2 Started");
            for (int i = 0; i <= 10; i++)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Method2 is in Progress!!");
                Thread.Sleep(1000);
            }
            Console.WriteLine("Method2 Exited");
            Console.WriteLine("Press any key to Exit.");
            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}

```

So, the point that you need to remember is once all the foreground thread including the main thread quits the application, then automatically all the background threads quit the application.

##### **Points to Remember:**

In C#, a thread is either a background thread or a foreground thread. Background threads are similar to the foreground threads, except that the background threads do not prevent a process from terminating. Once all the Foreground threads belonging to a process have terminated, then the CLR ends the process. Any remaining background threads are stopped and not completed.

By default, the following threads execute in the foreground (that is, their IsBackground property returns false):

1. The primary thread (or main application thread).
2. All threads are created by calling a Thread class constructor.

By default, the following threads execute in the background (that is, their IsBackground property returns true):

1. Thread pool threads are a pool of worker threads maintained by the runtime. You can configure the thread pool and schedule work on thread pool threads by using the ThreadPool class.

##### **Example for Better understanding Background and Foreground Threads in C#:**

In the below example, we are showing the behavior of foreground and background threads in C#. The code example will create a foreground thread and a background thread. The foreground thread keeps the process running until completes it’s for loop and terminates. The foreground thread has finished execution, the process is terminated before the background thread has completed execution.


```c#
using System;
using System.Threading;
namespace MultithreadingDemo
{
    public class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            ThreadingTest foregroundTest = new ThreadingTest(5);
            //Creating a Coreground Thread
            Thread foregroundThread = new Thread(new ThreadStart(foregroundTest.RunLoop));

            ThreadingTest backgroundTest = new ThreadingTest(50);
            //Creating a Background Thread
            Thread backgroundThread =new Thread(new ThreadStart(backgroundTest.RunLoop))
            {
                 IsBackground = true
            };

            foregroundThread.Start();
            backgroundThread.Start();
        }
    }
    class ThreadingTest
    {
        readonly int maxIterations;

        public ThreadingTest(int maxIterations)
        {
            this.maxIterations = maxIterations;
        }

        public void RunLoop()
        {
            for (int i = 0; i < maxIterations; i++)
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"{0} count: {1}", Thread.CurrentThread.IsBackground ? "Background Thread" : "Foreground Thread", i);
                Thread.Sleep(250);
            }
            Console.WriteLine("{0} finished counting.", Thread.CurrentThread.IsBackground ? "Background Thread" : "Foreground Thread");
        }
    }
}

```

**Note1:** In C#, the foreground threads have the ability to prevent the current application from terminating. The CLR will not shut down an application (which is to say, unload the hosting AppDomain) until all foreground threads have ended.

**Note2:** In C#, the Background threads are viewed by the CLR as expendable paths of execution that can be ignored at any point in time (even if they are currently doing some unit of work). Thus, if all foreground threads have terminated, any and all background threads are automatically killed when the application domain unloads.

# AutoResetEvent and ManualResetEvent in C##
##### **What is Signaling Methodology?**

Let us first understand what is Signalling Methodology and then we will understand how to implement the Signalling Methodology using AutoResetEvent and ManualResetEvent in C#. Let us understand this with an example. Please have a look at the below image. Let’s say we have two threads Thread1 and Thread2. And we need to implement thread synchronization between these two threads. For thread synchronization, here thread2 sends a signal to thread1 saying that please go under Wait mode. And then thread2 continues doing its work. And once thread2 finishes its work, again it sends a signal to thread1 saying that you can resume your work from where you halted.

![[Pasted image 20240418191550.png]]

So, in this way, by using the Signalling Methodology we can implement thread synchronization between multiple threads in C#. And both AutoResetEvent and ManualResetEvent in C# help us to achieve this. So, here, first, we will see an example using AutoResetEvent, then we will see an example using ManualResetEvent, and finally, we will see the differences between them.

##### **AutoResetEvent Class in C#:**

AutoResetEvent is used to send signals between two threads. This class Notifies a waiting thread that an event has occurred. If you go to the definition of AutoResetEvent class, then you will see the following. This is a sealed class and hence cannot be inherited. And it is inherited from the EventWaitHandle class.

![[word-image-468.webp]]

This class provides the following constructor that we can use to create an instance of the AutoResetEvent class in C#.

1. **AutoResetEvent(bool initialState):** It initializes a new instance of the AutoResetEvent class with a Boolean value indicating whether to set the initial state to signaled. Here, if the parameter initialState is true then it set the initial state to signaled; false to set the initial state to non-signaled.

The AutoResetEvent is inherited from the EventWaitHandle class and if you go to the definition of the EventWaitHandle class, then you will see that this EventWaitHandle class implements the WaitHandle class as shown in the below image, and the EventWaitHandle class also has the Set and Reset method that we are going to use with AutoResetEvent object.

![[word-image-469.webp]]

The following two methods of this class, we are going to use in our example.

1. **Set():** This method is used to set the state of the event to signaled, allowing one or more waiting threads to proceed. It returns true if the operation succeeds; otherwise, false.
2. **Reset():** This method is used to set the state of the event to non signaled, causing threads to block. It returns true if the operation succeeds; otherwise, false.

Again, the EventWaitHandle class is inherited from the WaitHandle and if you go to the definition of WaitHandle class, then you will see that it is an abstract class and this class has some overloaded versions of the WaitOne method as shown in the below image. The WaitOne method we are going to use with the AutoResetEvent object.

![[word-image-470.webp]]

We are going to use the following method in our example.

1. **WaitOne():** The WaitOne() method blocks the current thread until the current WaitHandle receives a signal. It returns true if the current instance receives a signal. If the current instance is never signaled, WaitHandle.WaitOne(System.Int32, System.Boolean) never returns.

##### **How AutoResetEvent Work in C#?**

The AutoResetEvent in C# maintains a boolean variable in memory. If the boolean variable is false then it blocks the thread and if the boolean variable is true it unblocks the thread. So, when we create an instance of AutoResetEvent class, we need to pass the default value of the boolean value to the constructor of AutoResetEvent class. The following is the syntax to instantiate an AutoResetEvent object.  
**AutoResetEvent autoResetEvent = new AutoResetEvent(false);**

##### **WaitOne Method**

The WaitOne method blocks the current thread and waits for the signal by another thread. That means the WaitOne method puts the current thread into a Sleep state of the thread. The WaitOne method returns true if it receives the signal else returns false. We need to call the WaitOne method on the AutoResetEvent object as follows.  
**autoResetEvent.WaitOne();**

Another overloaded version of the WaitOne method takes seconds as a parameter and will wait for the specified number of seconds. If it does not get any signal, then the thread will continue its work. Following is the syntax.  
**autoResetEvent.WaitOne(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(2)**

##### **Set Method**

The Set method sent the signal to the waiting thread to proceed with its work. Following is the syntax to call the Set method.  
**autoResetEvent.Set();**

**Note:** The most important point that you need to remember is both threads will share the same AutoResetEvent object. Any thread can enter into a wait state by calling the WaitOne() method of the AutoResetEvent object. When the other thread calls the Set() method it unblocks the waiting thread.

##### **Example to Understand AutoResetEvent in C#:**

Let us see an example to understand the AutoResetEvent in C#. In the below example, we have two threads. The Main thread will invoke the main method and the NewThread which will invoke the SomeMethod method. The main method will invoke the new thread and the new thread actually go and run the SomeMethod. And the SomeMethod will first print the first statement i.e. Starting….. and then it invokes the WaitOne() method which Put the current thread i.e.NewThread into the waiting state until it receives the signal. Then inside the static void Main method, when we press the enter key, it will invoke the Set method which will send a signal to other threads to resume their work i.e. send the signal to NewThread to resume its work, and the new thread then prints Finishing…….. on the console window.


```c#
using System;

using System.Threading;

namespace SemaphoreDemo

{

class Program

{

static AutoResetEvent autoResetEvent = new AutoResetEvent(false);

static void Main(string[] args)

{

Thread newThread = new Thread(SomeMethod)

{

Name = "NewThread"

};

newThread.Start(); //It will invoke the SomeMethod in a different thread

//To See how the SomeMethod goes in halt mode

//Once we enter any key it will call set method and the SomeMethod will Resume its work

Console.ReadLine();

//It will send a signal to other threads to resume their work

autoResetEvent.Set();

}

static void SomeMethod()

{

Console.WriteLine("Starting........");

//Put the current thread into waiting state until it receives the signal

autoResetEvent.WaitOne(); //It will make the thread in halt mode

Console.WriteLine("Finishing........");

Console.ReadLine(); //To see the output in the console

}

}

}


```

**Note:** There is no guarantee that every call to the Set method will release a thread. If two calls are too close together, so that the second call occurs before a thread has been released, only one thread is released. It’s as if the second call did not happen. Also, if Set is called when there are no threads waiting and the AutoResetEvent is already signaled, the call has no effect.

##### **ManualResetEvent Class in C#:**

The ManualResetEvent Class in C# works exactly the same as the AutoResetEvent Class in C#. Let us rewrite the same example using ManualResetEvent and then we will discuss the differences between them. Simply, replace the AutoResetEvent class with ManualResetEvent class in the below example.

```C#
using System;
using System.Threading;

namespace SemaphoreDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static ManualResetEvent manualResetEvent = new ManualResetEvent(false);

        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Thread newThread = new Thread(SomeMethod)
            {
                Name = "NewThread"
            };
            newThread.Start(); //It will invoke the SomeMethod in a different thread

            //To See how the SomeMethod goes in halt mode
            //Once we enter any key it will call set method and the SomeMethod will Resume its work
            Console.ReadLine();

            //It will send a signal to other threads to resume their work
            manualResetEvent.Set();
        }

        static void SomeMethod()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Starting........");
            //Put the current thread into waiting state until it receives the signal
            manualResetEvent.WaitOne(); //It will make the thread in halt mode

            Console.WriteLine("Finishing........");
            Console.ReadLine(); //To see the output in the console
        }
    }
}

```

##### **What are the Differences between AutoResetEvent and ManualResetEvent in C#?**

Let us understand the differences with some examples. In AutoResetEvent, for every WaitOne method, there should be a Set method. That means if we are using the WaitOne method 2 times, then we should use the Set method 2 times. If we use the Set method 1 time, then the 2nd WaitOne method will be hung in the waiting state and will not be released.

```C#
using System;
using System.Threading;

namespace SemaphoreDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static AutoResetEvent manualResetEvent = new AutoResetEvent(false);

        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Thread newThread = new Thread(SomeMethod)
            {
                Name = "NewThread"
            };
            newThread.Start(); //It will invoke the SomeMethod in a different thread

            //To See how the SomeMethod goes in halt state let sleep the main thread for 3 secs
            Thread.Sleep(3000);
            Console.WriteLine("Releasing the WaitOne 1 by Set 1");
            manualResetEvent.Set(); //Set 1 will relase the Wait 1

            //To See how the SomeMethod goes in halt state let sleep the main thread for 3 secs
            Thread.Sleep(5000);
            Console.WriteLine("Releasing the WaitOne 2 by Set 2");
            manualResetEvent.Set(); //Set 2 will relase the Wait 2
            Console.ReadKey();
        }

        static void SomeMethod()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Starting 1........");
            manualResetEvent.WaitOne(); //Wait 1
            Console.WriteLine("Finishing 1........");
            Console.WriteLine();
            Console.WriteLine("Starting 2........");
            manualResetEvent.WaitOne(); //Wait 2
            Console.WriteLine("Finishing 2........");
        }
    }
}

```

For each WaitOne method, we should and must have a Set method if we are using AutoResetEvent in C#. If we have two WaitOne methods and we have one Set method, then the second WaitOne method will hang in the sleep mode and will not release. For a better understanding, please have a look at the below example

```C#
using System;
using System.Threading;

namespace SemaphoreDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static AutoResetEvent manualResetEvent = new AutoResetEvent(false);

        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Thread newThread = new Thread(SomeMethod)
            {
                Name = "NewThread"
            };
            newThread.Start(); //It will invoke the SomeMethod in a different thread

            //To See how the SomeMethod goes in halt state let sleep the main thread for 3 secs
            Thread.Sleep(3000);
            Console.WriteLine("Releasing the WaitOne 1 by Set 1");
            manualResetEvent.Set(); //Set 1 will relase the Wait 1
            
            Console.ReadKey();
        }

        static void SomeMethod()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Starting 1........");
            manualResetEvent.WaitOne(); //Wait 1
            Console.WriteLine("Finishing 1........");
            Console.WriteLine();
            Console.WriteLine("Starting 2........");
            manualResetEvent.WaitOne(); //Wait 2
            Console.WriteLine("Finishing 2........");
        }
    }
}

```

But if we write the previous example using ManualResetEvent then it will work. That is one Set method in ManualResetEvent can release all the WaitOne methods. For a better understanding, please have a look at the below example.

```C#
using System;
using System.Threading;

namespace SemaphoreDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static ManualResetEvent manualResetEvent = new ManualResetEvent(false);

        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Thread newThread = new Thread(SomeMethod)
            {
                Name = "NewThread"
            };
            newThread.Start(); //It will invoke the SomeMethod in a different thread

            //To See how the SomeMethod goes in halt state let sleep the main thread for 3 secs
            Thread.Sleep(3000);
            Console.WriteLine("Releasing the WaitOne 1 by Set 1");
            manualResetEvent.Set(); //Set will release all the WaitOne
            
            Console.ReadKey();
        }

        static void SomeMethod()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Starting 1........");
            manualResetEvent.WaitOne(); //Wait 1
            Console.WriteLine("Finishing 1........");
            Console.WriteLine();
            Console.WriteLine("Starting 2........");
            manualResetEvent.WaitOne(); //Wait 2
            Console.WriteLine("Finishing 2........");
        }
    }
}

```
