![[controllers-in-asp-net-core-mvc-application.webp]]

1. client  Request ->  Controller 
2.  Controller   ->  Send   Model Or View 
3.  View -> send model 
4.  view Or model ->  send controller 
5. Controller -> send   Client   response

1. **MVC Controller – Empty**: It will create an Empty Controller.
2. **MVC Controller with read/write actions**: This template will create the controller with five action methods to create, read, update, delete, and list entities.
3. **MVC Controller with views, using Entity Framework**: This template will create an MVC Controller with actions and Razor views to create, read, update, delete, and list entities using Entity Framework.

##### **Rules for Controller:**

1. **Naming Convention:** Controllers are typically named with the suffix Controller, like HomeController or ProductController.
2. **Inheriting from ControllerBase:** Controllers usually inherit from the ControllerBase or Controller class, which provides many methods and properties for handling requests and responses.

##### **What are Action Methods?**

All the public methods of a controller class are known as Action Methods. They are created for a specific action or operation in the application. The Controller class can have many related action methods. For example, adding a Student is an action. Modifying the student data is another action. Deleting a student is another action. So, all the related actions should be created inside a particular controller.


```c#
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
namespace FirstCoreMVCWebApplication.Controllers
{
    public class StudentController : Controller
    {
        public string GetAllStudents()
        {
            return "Return All Students";
        }
    }
}
```

##### **How Do We Call an Action Method of a Controller?**

When our application receives an HTTP Request, the controller action method handles it. So, when we say we are hitting a controller, we are hitting its action method.

examples **http:domain.com/ControllerName/ActionMethodName.**
URL: ```
 ```c#
http://localhost:<portnumber>/student/GetAllStudents
```

##### **How to Pass Parameters in Action Methods?**
we want to search for students based on their names. To do so, add the following action method inside the Student Controller.

```c#
public string GetStudentsByName(string name)
{
    return $"Return All Students with Name : {name}";
}

  // Get Stduent Details 
  public ActionResult Details(int studentId)
  {
      StudentBusinessLayer studentBL = new StudentBusinessLayer();
      Student studentDetail = studentBL.GetById(studentId);
      return View(studentDetail);
  }
```

Now run the application, navigate to the URL
```c#
//1. query String 
http://localhost:<portnumber>/student/GetStudentsByName?name=james
// 2. direct pass paramiter   name my parameter  pass value 
	http://localhost:<portnumber>/student/GetStudentsByName/kamal
	https://localhost:7075/Student/Details/1
```
