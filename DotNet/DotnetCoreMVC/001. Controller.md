##### **How Controllers Work in ASP.NET Core?**

![[controllers-in-asp-net-core-mvc-application.webp]]

1. client  Request ->  Controller 
2.  Controller   ->  Send   Model Or View 
3.  View -> send model 
4.  view Or model ->  send controller 
5. Controller -> send   Client   response 



## Create a  MVC Project   
	if project   empty MVC then add Contllers folder  
##### **Step 1: Adding Controllers Folder**
	
##### **Step 2: Adding Controller in ASP.NET Core**
![[Adding-Controller-in-ASP.NET-Core-1024x408.webp]]

1. **MVC Controller – Empty**: It will create an Empty Controller.
2. **MVC Controller with read/write actions**: This template will create the controller with five action methods to create, read, update, delete, and list entities.
3. **MVC Controller with views, using Entity Framework**: This template will create an MVC Controller with actions and Razor views to create, read, update, delete, and list entities using Entity Framework.

##### **Rules for Controller:**

1. **Naming Convention:** Controllers are typically named with the suffix Controller, like HomeController or ProductController.
2. **Inheriting from ControllerBase:** Controllers usually inherit from the ControllerBase or Controller class, which provides many methods and properties for handling requests and responses.

##### **What are Action Methods?**

All the public methods of a controller class are known as Action Methods. They are created for a specific action or operation in the application. The Controller class can have many related action methods. For example, adding a Student is an action. Modifying the student data is another action. Deleting a student is another action. So, all the related actions should be created inside a particular controller.


```c#
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
namespace FirstCoreMVCWebApplication.Controllers
{
    public class StudentController : Controller
    {
        public string GetAllStudents()
        {
            return "Return All Students";
        }
    }
}
```

##### **How Do We Call an Action Method of a Controller?**

When our application receives an HTTP Request, the controller action method handles it. So, when we say we are hitting a controller, we are hitting its action method.

examples **http:domain.com/ControllerName/ActionMethodName.**
URL: ```
 ```c#
http://localhost:<portnumber>/student/GetAllStudents
```

##### **How to Pass Parameters in Action Methods?**
we want to search for students based on their names. To do so, add the following action method inside the Student Controller.

```c#
public string GetStudentsByName(string name)
{
    return $"Return All Students with Name : {name}";
}

  // Get Stduent Details 
  public ActionResult Details(int studentId)
  {
      StudentBusinessLayer studentBL = new StudentBusinessLayer();
      Student studentDetail = studentBL.GetById(studentId);
      return View(studentDetail);
  }
```

Now run the application, navigate to the URL
```c#
//1. query String 
http://localhost:<portnumber>/student/GetStudentsByName?name=james
// 2. direct pass paramiter   name my parameter  pass value 
	http://localhost:<portnumber>/student/GetStudentsByName/kamal
	https://localhost:7075/Student/Details/1
```

##### **How is Controller Instance Created in ASP.NET Core MVC?**

To create an ASP.NET Core MVC Application, we need to add the required MVC Services and Middleware Components into the Request Processing Pipeline. For example, you can add the MVC services using the following statement within your Main method of the Program.cs class file.

Then, we need to configure the MVC Middleware into the Request Processing Pipeline. For example, the following code will add the MVC Middleware Component to the Application Processing Pipeline
![[word-image-29911-2-2.webp]]

So, in the ASP.NET Core MVC Web Application, the MVC Middleware Component receives an HTTP Request when the client sends an HTTP Request. Once the MVC Middleware Component receives the request, based on routing, it selects the controller and action method to execute.


The MVC Middleware uses Reflection to create an instance of the Controller class. This will use the following 

**IControllerActivator** class. As you can see, this interface provides three methods: Create, Release, and ReleaseAsync.

##### **DefaultControllerActivator**

Now, the above interface is implemented by the **DefaultControllerActivator** class, which implements the **IControllerActivator** interface methods and provides the logic to create and release the controller.
