##### **What is a Model in ASP.NET Core MVC?**

In the ASP.NET Core MVC application, a model is a class with a .cs (for C#) extension that defines the Properties and behaviors of the data entities in your application. These are simple classes that represent the objects in your application. For example, a Product model might contain properties such as ID, Name, Price, and methods that define operations related to a product.

That means the Models in the ASP.NET Core MVC Application contain a set of classes representing the domain data (you can also say the business data) and logic (validation, business, and data access logic) to manage the domain/business data. The Model is the component in the MVC Design pattern used to manage the data, i.e., the state of the application in memory.


Models are responsible for storing the data that is used on Views. Views are the HTML Pages that get rendered into the client’s browser. In the browser, we generally perform two operations. First, we display the data to the user; second, we get the data from the user. For both these operations, models are used.


##### **Where Will We Create the Models in the MVC Application?**

It is not mandatory, but creating all the Model classes within the Models folder is a good programming practice. Even though you can also create a separate class library project, put all the model classes in that class library project, and refer to that class library project in your MVC application. We will discuss this as we progress in this course.

When you create a new ASP.NET Core Web Application using the Model-View-Controller Template, all the model classes are created inside the Models folder by default. We are also going to follow this naming convention. Let us see how to create and work with models in an ASP.NET Core MVC Application.

##### **Adding Models Folder in ASP.NET Core Application:**

Right-click on your project, then select **add => new folder** option from the context menu to add a new folder. Then, rename the folder name as **Models**. Here, we want to create a model for displaying student data. So, create a class file named **Student.cs** within the **Models** folder. Once you create the Student model, then the folder structure of your application should


```C#

// Student.cs
namespace FirstCoreMVCWebApplication.Models
{
    public class Student
    {
        public int StudentId { get; set; }
        public string? Name { get; set; }
        public string? Branch { get; set; }
        public string? Section { get; set; }
        public string? Gender { get; set; }
    }
}
```


This is our student model, which will store the student data in memory. As we already discussed, the model also contains business logic to manage the data. So, in our example, to manage the student data,


##### **Creating IStudentRepository interface:**

```c#
namespace FirstCoreMVCWebApplication.Models
{
    public interface IStudentRepository
    {
        Student GetStudentById(int StudentId);
    }
}
```

##### **Creating StudentRepository class:**
Let us create an implementation class for the above **IStudentRepository** interface.

```c#
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;

namespace FirstCoreMVCWebApplication.Models
{
    public class StudentRepository : IStudentRepository
    {
        public List<Student> DataSource()
        {
            return new List<Student>()
            {
                new Student() { StudentId = 101, Name = "James", Branch = "CSE", Section = "A", Gender = "Male" },
                new Student() { StudentId = 102, Name = "Smith", Branch = "ETC", Section = "B", Gender = "Male" },
                new Student() { StudentId = 103, Name = "David", Branch = "CSE", Section = "A", Gender = "Male" },
                new Student() { StudentId = 104, Name = "Sara", Branch = "CSE", Section = "A", Gender = "Female" },
                new Student() { StudentId = 105, Name = "Pam", Branch = "ETC", Section = "B", Gender = "Female" }
            };
        }

        public Student GetStudentById(int StudentId)
        {
            return DataSource().FirstOrDefault(e => e.StudentId == StudentId) ?? new Student();
        }
    }
}
```


##### **Modify StudentController:**

We already created a Controller named **StudentController** within the Controllers Folder. If you have not created it, add a class file named StudentController within the Controllers folder. Then, modify the StudentController as shown below to use the StudentRepository to retrieve the student details.

```c#
using FirstCoreMVCWebApplication.Models;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;

namespace FirstCoreMVCWebApplication.Controllers
{
    public class StudentController : Controller
    {
        public JsonResult GetStudentDetails(int Id)
        {
            StudentRepository repository = new StudentRepository();
            Student studentDetails = repository.GetStudentById(Id);
            return Json(studentDetails);
        }
    }
}
```



```C#
// config program.cs
namespace FirstCoreMVCWebApplication
{
    public class Program
    {
        public static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            // Create a WebApplication builder, which provides various configuration settings
            // and services for the web application
            var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

            // Add MVC services to the service container.
            // This includes support for controllers and views.
            builder.Services.AddMvc();

            // Build the application using the configured builder
            var app = builder.Build();

            // Enable routing middleware, which matches incoming HTTP requests to endpoints defined in the application
            app.UseRouting();

            // Map the default controller route (convention: {controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id?})
            // This means if no specific route is provided, it will default to HomeController and Index action
            app.MapControllerRoute(
                name: "default", // Name of the route
                pattern: "{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id?}" // URL pattern for the route
            );

            // Run the application, which blocks the calling thread and starts listening for incoming HTTP requests
            app.Run();
        }
    }
}
```

##### **Use Cases of Models in MVC Design Pattern:**

- Data Representation: Models represent the data in memory used by your application. They typically map to database tables or external data sources.
- Business Logic: Models may contain business rules and validation logic, ensuring data integrity and consistency.
- Communication: Models facilitate communication between different parts of the application, such as controllers, views, and data access layers.
