##### **What is a View in ASP.NET Core MVC Application?**

In Model-View-Controller (MVC) Design Pattern, the View is the component that contains logic to represent the model data (the model data provided to it by a controller) as a user interface with which the end-user can interact. That means View is used to render the user interface. Views are the components in ASP.NET Core MVC that handle the application’s presentation logic. They are responsible for rendering HTML markup sent to the client’s browser, typically written using the Razor syntax.

A view in ASP.NET Core MVC Application is a file with “**.cshtml**” (for C# language) extension. The meaning of **cshtml = CS (C Sharp) + HTML**. The View combines programming language (C#) and HTML (Hypertext Mark-up Language). The Views in the ASP.NET Core MVC Application are generally returned to the client from the Controller Action Method.


##### **Types of Views in ASP.NET Core MVC:**

In ASP.NET Core MVC, there are four Types of Views. They are as follows:

- **Razor Views:** These are the most common views in ASP.NET Core MVC. They use the Razor syntax (.cshtml files), which is a combination of HTML and C#.
- **Partial Views:** These are reusable view components that can be embedded within other views. They are useful for rendering common elements like headers, footers, or navigation menus.
- **View Components:** These are similar to partial views but more powerful. They can encapsulate both the view and the logic needed to generate it.
- **Layout Views:** These provide a consistent look and feel across multiple views in your application. They define a common template for your pages, including headers, footers, and navigation bars. They define a common structure (like master pages in ASP.NET Web Forms).

##### **Where are Views Placed in ASP.NET Core MVC Application?**

By default, Views are available inside the **Views** folder, created in the project root directory. Usually, views are grouped into folder names with the controller names. Each controller will have its own folder in which the controller-specific view files will be stored. The controller-specific folders will be created only within the Views folder. 

Let’s say we have an ASP.NET Core MVC application with two controllers, i.e., HomeController and StudentController. The HomeController is created with the following three action methods.

1. **AboutUs()**
2. **ContactUs()**
3. **Index()**

On the other hand, StudentController is created with the following four action methods.

1. **Index()**
2. **Details()**
3. **Edit()**
4. **Delete()**

##### **Example to Understand Views in ASP.NET Core MVC Application:**

We will work with the same example we created in our [**ASP.NET Core Controllers**](https://dotnettutorials.net/lesson/controllers-asp-net-core-mvc/) article and continue in [**Models in the ASP.NET Core**](https://dotnettutorials.net/lesson/model-asp-net-core-mvc/) article.


##### **Adding Home Controller**

```c#
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
namespace FirstCoreMVCWebApplication.Controllers
{
    public class HomeController : Controller
    {
        public ViewResult Index()
        {
            return View();
        }
    }
}
```
 ### Adding View 
Now open **Index.cshtml** file and then copy and paste the following code into it.

```c#
@{
    Layout = null;
}

<!DOCTYPE html>

<html>
<head>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />
    <title>Index</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Index view belongs to Views/Home folder</h1>
</body>
</html>
```


##### **Understanding View() Method in ASP.NET Core MVC Application:**

##### **View() vs View(object model) Extension Methods:**

![[word-image-43.webp]]

##### **View(string viewName) vs**  **View(string viewName, object model) Extension Methods:**

If you want to return a view from an action method whose name is different than the action method name, then you need to use either View(string viewName) or View(string viewName, object model) Methods. If you want to pass model data to the view, you need to use the View(string viewName, object model) method; otherwise, you can use the View(string viewName) method, which takes the view name as a parameter.

To understand this concept, let’s create a view with the name **Test.cshtml** within the **Home** folder.

```c#
@{
    Layout = null;
}

<!DOCTYPE html>

<html>
<head>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />
    <title>Test</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Test view coming from Views/Home Folder</h1>
</body>
</html>
```


### Controller 

```c#
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
namespace FirstCoreMVCWebApplication.Controllers
{
    public class HomeController : Controller
    {
        public ViewResult Index()
        {
            return View("Test");
        }
    }
}
```

##### **How do you specify the Absolute View File Path?**

```c#
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
namespace FirstCoreMVCWebApplication.Controllers
{
    public class HomeController : Controller
    {
        public ViewResult Index()
        {
            return View("Views/Home/Test.cshtml");
        }
    }
}
```

![[specifying-the-absolute-view-file-path.webp]]

##### **Absolute Path:**

- An absolute path is a complete path from the application’s root to the view file. It usually starts with a forward slash (/) or a tilde and forward slash (~/), which represents the web application’s root.
- Example: **return View(“~/Views/Home/Index.cshtml”);**

##### **Relative Path**

- A relative path is relative to the location of the calling controller. In ASP.NET Core, the default convention is to look for views in a folder that matches the controller name within the Views folder.
- Example: If you have a HomeController, calling **return View(“Index”)** will, by default, look for the view in **Views/Home/Index.cshtml**.

##### **When to Use:**

- Use relative paths when the views are located in the conventional locations (e.g., **Views/[ControllerName]/[ViewName].cshtml)**.
- Use absolute paths when referencing a view outside the conventional locations or to ensure the path remains valid regardless of controller location.
##### **Another way of Creating Views:**


```c#
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
namespace FirstCoreMVCWebApplication.Controllers
{
    public class HomeController : Controller
    {
        public ViewResult Index()
        {
            return View();
        }
        public ViewResult About()
        {
            return View();
        }
    }
}
```
