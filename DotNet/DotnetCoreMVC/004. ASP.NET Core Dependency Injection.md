##### **Understanding the Need for ASP.NET Core Dependency Injection**

ASP.NET Core Dependency Injection (DI) is a powerful feature that helps manage object dependencies within our application. DI is a design pattern used to achieve loose coupling in software development. Instead of creating dependencies (objects or services) directly within a class, dependencies are injected into the class from outside, typically through constructor parameters.
 ```c#
// Student.cs
 namespace FirstCoreMVCWebApplication.Models
{
    public class Student
    {
        public int StudentId { get; set; }
        public string? Name { get; set; }
        public string? Branch { get; set; }
        public string? Section { get; set; }
        public string? Gender { get; set; }
    }
}
```

##### **Creating Service Interface:**

Next, create an interface named **IStudentRepository.cs** within the Models folder. This interface will declare the methods or operations we can perform on the student data.

```c#
using System.Collections.Generic;
namespace FirstCoreMVCWebApplication.Models
{
    public interface IStudentRepository
    {
        Student GetStudentById(int StudentId);
        List<Student> GetAllStudent();
    }
}
```


##### **Creating Service Implementation:**
create a class file named **StudentRepository.cs** within the same **Models** folder. Then open the **StudentRepository.cs** class file and copy-paste the following code. This class implements the **IStudentRepository** interface by implementing the two methods declared in the IStudentRepository interface.

```c#
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;

namespace FirstCoreMVCWebApplication.Models
{
    public class StudentRepository : IStudentRepository
    {
        public List<Student> DataSource()
        {
            return new List<Student>()
            {
                new Student() { StudentId = 101, Name = "James", Branch = "CSE", Section = "A", Gender = "Male" },
                new Student() { StudentId = 102, Name = "Smith", Branch = "ETC", Section = "B", Gender = "Male" },
                new Student() { StudentId = 103, Name = "David", Branch = "CSE", Section = "A", Gender = "Male" },
                new Student() { StudentId = 104, Name = "Sara", Branch = "CSE", Section = "A", Gender = "Female" },
                new Student() { StudentId = 105, Name = "Pam", Branch = "ETC", Section = "B", Gender = "Female" }
            };
        }

        public Student GetStudentById(int StudentId)
        {
            return DataSource().FirstOrDefault(e => e.StudentId == StudentId) ?? new Student();
        }

        public List<Student> GetAllStudent()
        {
            return DataSource();
        }
    }
}
```


## Configur  program.cs

```c#
namespace FirstCoreMVCWebApplication
{
    public class Program
    {
        public static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

            builder.Services.AddMvc();

            var app = builder.Build();

            app.UseRouting();

            app.MapControllerRoute(
                name: "default", 
                pattern: "{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id?}" 
            );

            app.Run();
        }
    }
}
```

##### **Without Dependency Injection:**

Create a folder named Controllers in your project. Then, add a class file named **HomeController.cs** within the Controllers folder and copy-paste the following code. Here, you can see that within the Index and GetStudentDetails action methods, we are creating an instance of the StudentRepository class and calling the respective methods.

```c#
using FirstCoreMVCWebApplication.Models;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using System.Collections.Generic;

namespace FirstCoreMVCWebApplication.Controllers
{
    public class HomeController : Controller
    {
        public JsonResult Index()
        {
            StudentRepository repository = new StudentRepository();
            List<Student> allStudentDetails = repository.GetAllStudent();
            return Json(allStudentDetails);
        }

        public JsonResult GetStudentDetails(int Id)
        {
            StudentRepository repository = new StudentRepository();
            Student studentDetails = repository.GetStudentById(Id);
            return Json(studentDetails);
        }
    }
}
```

##### **What are the Different Methods ASP.NET Core Provides to Register a Service with the Dependency Injection Container?**

ASP.NET Core provides 3 methods for registering a service with the ASP.NET Core Dependency Injection container. The method we use to register a service will determine its lifetime.

##### **ingleton:**

Services registered as Singleton are instantiated once per application and shared throughout its lifetime. It is Ideal for configuration services, logging, or other services where a single instance is sufficient and expensive to create. All requests for the service within the application receive the same instance. The container ensures thread safety when accessing the singleton instance. Exists for the entire duration of the application. This can be achieved by adding the service as a singleton through the AddSingleton method of the IServiceCollection.

##### **Transient:**

Services registered as Transient are created each time they are requested. This method is suitable for lightweight, stateless services with short-lived and transient behavior. A new instance is created every time the service is requested, and instances are not shared among different consumers. This can be achieved by adding the service through the AddTransient method of the IServiceCollection.

##### **Scoped:**

Services registered as Scoped are created once per request (in a web application, this typically means per HTTP request). It is used for services that should be reused within a single request, maintaining state across different components of the request, but should not be shared across different requests. Instances are disposed of at the end of the request. Common examples include data access operations within a single transaction. This can be achieved by adding the service through the AddScoped method of the IServiceCollection.

##### **Registering the StudentRepository with ASP.NET Core Dependency Injection** 

We need to register the service to the built-in dependency injection container with the program class.

##### **What is the ServiceDescriptor Class in .NET Core?**

The ServiceDescriptor Class is part of the Dependency Injection (DI) framework provided by Microsoft in the ASP.NET Core framework. It describes how a service (an interface or a concrete type) should be registered with the DI container. It encapsulates information about the service’s type, implementation, and lifetime (singleton, transient, scoped). Essentially, it defines the configuration that the DI container uses to resolve dependencies.

##### **Extension Methods for Registration**

ASP.NET Core framework includes extension methods for each type of lifetime: **AddSingleton(), AddTransient(), and AddScoped()** methods for singleton, transient, and scoped lifetime, respectively. The following example shows how to register types (services) using extension methods.
![[Extension-Methods-for-Registration-1-1024x356.webp]]

```c#
namespace FirstCoreMVCWebApplication
{
    public class Program
    {
        public static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

            // Add Framework MVC services to the Container.
            builder.Services.AddMvc();

            //Application Service
            builder.Services.AddSingleton<IStudentRepository, StudentRepository>();
            //builder.Services.AddSingleton(typeof(IStudentRepository), typeof(StudentRepository));
            //builder.Services.AddTransient<IStudentRepository, StudentRepository>();
            //builder.Services.AddTransient(typeof(IStudentRepository), typeof(StudentRepository));
            //builder.Services.AddScoped<IStudentRepository, StudentRepository>();
            //builder.Services.AddScoped(typeof(IStudentRepository), typeof(StudentRepository));

            //Add Application Service to the Container.
            //builder.Services.Add(new ServiceDescriptor(typeof(IStudentRepository),
            //    new StudentRepository())); // by default singleton
            //builder.Services.Add(new ServiceDescriptor(typeof(IStudentRepository),
            //    typeof(StudentRepository), ServiceLifetime.Singleton)); // singleton
            //builder.Services.Add(new ServiceDescriptor(typeof(IStudentRepository),
            //    typeof(StudentRepository), ServiceLifetime.Transient)); // Transient
            //builder.Services.Add(new ServiceDescriptor(typeof(IStudentRepository),
            //    typeof(StudentRepository), ServiceLifetime.Scoped));    // Scoped

            var app = builder.Build();
            app.UseRouting();

            app.MapControllerRoute(
                name: "default", 
                pattern: "{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id?}" 
            );

            app.Run();
        }
    }
}
```


##### **Constructor Injection in ASP.NET Core MVC Application**

Once we register the service, the IoC container automatically performs constructor injection if a service type is included as a parameter in a constructor. Let us modify the HomeController, as shown below, to use Constructor Dependency Injection in the ASP.NET Core MVC Application.

```c#
using FirstCoreMVCWebApplication.Models;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using System.Collections.Generic;

namespace FirstCoreMVCWebApplication.Controllers
{
    public class HomeController : Controller
    {
        //Create a reference variable of IStudentRepository
        private readonly IStudentRepository? _repository = null;

        //Initialize the variable through constructor
        public HomeController(IStudentRepository repository)
        {
            _repository = repository;
        }

        public JsonResult Index()
        {
            List<Student>? allStudentDetails = _repository?.GetAllStudent();
            return Json(allStudentDetails);
        }

        public JsonResult GetStudentDetails(int Id)
        {
            Student? studentDetails = _repository?.GetStudentById(Id);
            return Json(studentDetails);
        }
    }
}
```

###### **Code Explanation:**

In the above example, the IoC container will automatically inject an instance of the **StudentRepository** into the constructor of HomeController. We don’t need to do anything else. The IoC container will create and dispose of an instance of the IStudentRepository based on the registered lifetime. Injecting the dependency object through a constructor is called a constructor dependency injection.

We created the _ **repository** variable as read-only, ensuring that once we inject the dependency object, that value can never be changed. At this point, run the application, and you should get the output as expected, as shown in the below image.


##### **Action Method Injection in ASP.NET Core Application**

Sometimes, we only need a dependency object in a single action method. In that case, we need to use the **[FromServices]** attribute. For a better understanding, please modify the HomeController class as follows. We are using the **[FromServices]** attribute within the **Index** action method. So, at runtime, the IoC Container will inject the dependency object into the IStudentRepository repository reference variable. Injecting the dependency object through a method is called method dependency injection.

##### **Get Services Manually in ASP.NET Core**

We can also manually access the services configured with built-in IoC containers using the **RequestServices** property of **HttpContext**. The GetService method in ASP.NET Core Dependency Injection (DI) is used to retrieve a service from the DI container. It is provided by the IServiceProvider interface and allows for dynamic service resolution at runtime. So, modify the HomeController class as shown below to access the dependent service manually.


```c#
using FirstCoreMVCWebApplication.Models;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using System.Collections.Generic;

namespace FirstCoreMVCWebApplication.Controllers
{
    public class HomeController : Controller
    {
        public JsonResult Index()
        {
            var services = this.HttpContext.RequestServices;
           
            IStudentRepository? _repository = (IStudentRepository?)services.GetService(typeof(IStudentRepository));
            List<Student>? allStudentDetails = _repository?.GetAllStudent();
            return Json(allStudentDetails);
        }

        public JsonResult GetStudentDetails(int Id)
        {
            var services = this.HttpContext.RequestServices;
            IStudentRepository? _repository = (IStudentRepository?)services.GetService(typeof(IStudentRepository));
            Student? studentDetails = _repository?.GetStudentById(Id);
            return Json(studentDetails);
        }
    }
}
```

##### **What are the Advantages of using ASP.NET Core Dependency Injection?**

The ASP.NET Core Dependency Injection allows us to develop loosely coupled software components. Here are some of the advantages of using dependency injection in ASP.NET Core:

1. **Loose Coupling:** Using dependency injection, we can separate our classes from their dependencies, resulting in simpler code to maintain and test.
2. **Testability:** By using dependency injection, we can increase the testability of our code by easily replacing dependencies with mock objects during unit testing.
3. **Extensibility:** Using Dependency injection enhances the extensibility of our code by offering the flexibility to switch out dependencies conveniently.
4. **Reusability:** Using dependency injection makes our code more reusable since we can conveniently share dependencies among various classes
