##### **How do you Pass Data to Views in ASP.NET Core MVC?**

In ASP.NET Core MVC Applications, we can pass the data from a controller action method to a view in many different ways, such as by using [**ViewBag**](https://dotnettutorials.net/lesson/viewbag-asp-net-core-mvc/), [**ViewData**](https://dotnettutorials.net/lesson/viewdata-asp-net-core-mvc/), [**TempData**](https://dotnettutorials.net/lesson/tempdata-in-asp-net-core-mvc/), and a [**Strongly Typed Model**](https://dotnettutorials.net/lesson/strongly-typed-view-asp-net-core-mvc/). In this article, I will show you how to use ViewData to pass the data from the controller action method to a view. The other three techniques, i.e., ViewBag, Tempdate, and Strongly Typed View Model, will be discussed in our upcoming articles.


##### **What is ViewData in ASP.NET Core MVC Application?**

ViewData is a dictionary object in ASP.NET Core MVC that allows us to pass data from a controller action method to a view. It provides a flexible way to pass data, allowing us to use key-value pairs. ViewData is useful when we need to pass dynamic data or data that doesn’t fit well into a strongly typed model. If you go to the definition of ViewData, you will see that It is a property in the Controller abstract class, and its type is **ViewDataDictionary**. This property is also decorated with the ViewDataDictionary attribute, as shown in the image below.

The ViewDataDictionary class implements the IDictionary. So, **ViewData in ASP.NET Core MVC** is a dictionary object. As a dictionary object, it stores data in the form of Key-Value Pairs, where each key must be a string, and the value that we pass to the dictionary will be stored as an **object type**.

##### **How do you use ViewData in the ASP.NET Core MVC Application?**

To use ViewData in the ASP.NET Core MVC Application, we need to set the data in a controller by adding entries to the ViewData dictionary with a string key and then assign some data. The key should be in string format, and you can give any name to the key. Then, you can assign any data to this key, such as the following.  
**ViewData[“KeyName”] = “Some Data”;**

Since ViewData is a server-side code, hence to use it on a view, we need to use the razor syntax, i.e., @ something as follows.  
**@ViewData[“KeyName”]**

##### **Understand ViewData in ASP.NET Core MVC Application:**

Let us see an example of using ViewData to pass data from a controller action method to a view. In our example, we want to pass three pieces of information from the controller action method to the view. One is the Page’s title, the second is the page’s Header, and the third is the Student data.

So, first, create an ASP.NET Core Web Application (with the name **FirstCoreMVCWebApplication**) with MVC (Model-View-Controller) Project Template, i.e., Creating ASP.NET Core Application using ASP.NET Core Web APP (Model-View-Controller) Template. Once you create the project, add a class file named **Student.cs** in the Models folder. Then, please copy and paste the code below into it.

```C#
namespace FirstCoreMVCWebApplication.Models
{
    public class Student
    {
        public int StudentId { get; set; }
        public string? Name { get; set; }
        public string? Branch { get; set; }
        public string? Section { get; set; }
        public string? Gender { get; set; }
    }
}
```

##### **Modifying HomeController:**

Next, modify the Home Controller class as shown below. Here, we remove the existing code and add one action method, i.e., Details. As part of this method, we create three ViewData objects to store the Title, Header, and Student data. Here, Title, Header, and Student are the keys of the ViewData Dictionary Object.

```C#
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using FirstCoreMVCWebApplication.Models;

namespace FirstCoreMVCWebApplication.Controllers
{
    public class HomeController : Controller
    {
        public ViewResult Details()
        {
            //String string Data
            ViewData["Title"] = "Student Details Page";
            ViewData["Header"] = "Student Details";

            Student student = new Student()
            {
                StudentId = 101,
                Name = "James",
                Branch = "CSE",
                Section = "A",
                Gender = "Male"
            };

            //storing Student Data
            ViewData["Student"] = student;

            return View();
        }
    }
}
```

##### **Creating Details.cshtml View:**

In our previous article, we discussed the different ways to create Views in ASP.NET Core MVC Applications. Let us add a view named **Details.cshtml** within the **Home** folder, which is inside the **Views** folder, as shown below. Once you add the Details view, your Views folder structure should look as shown below.
![[DotNet/DotnetCoreMVC/Images/word-image-50.webp]]

Now open the **Details.cshtml** view and copy and paste the following code. As you can see in the code below, we directly access the string data from the ViewData without type casting. However, while accessing the Student data from the ViewData, we typecast it to the appropriate Student type.

```C#
@{
    Layout = null;
}

<!DOCTYPE html>

<html>
<head>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />
    <title>@ViewData["Title"]</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>@ViewData["Header"]</h1>

    @{
        var student = ViewData["Student"] as FirstCoreMVCWebApplication.Models.Student;
    }

    <div>
        StudentId : @student?.StudentId
    </div>
    <div>
        Name : @student?.Name
    </div>
    <div>
        Branch : @student?.Branch
    </div>
    <div>
        Section : @student?.Section
    </div>
    <div>
        Gender : @student?.Gender
    </div>
</body>
</html>
```

Now run the application and navigate to the “**/Home/Details**” URL. As shown below, you will see the data as expected.

##### **Features of ViewData in ASP.NET Core MVC:**

- **Type Safety:** ViewData does not provide type safety as it stores data as an object. You need to cast the data to the appropriate type when retrieving it.
- **Scope:** The data in ViewData only lasts for the duration of the current HTTP request. It’s reset for each new request, so it is not a mechanism for persisting data between requests, such as across redirects.
- **Accessing Data:** You can set data in a controller by adding entries to the ViewData dictionary with a string key. In the view, you can access these values using the same key. When used in the view, the values must be cast to the appropriate type.
- **Null Handling:** ViewData returns null if a key does not exist, so you should check for null or use the ?. operator to avoid exceptions.
- **Usage:** ViewData is best used to pass small amounts of data. If you’re passing complex data or require type safety, consider using ViewBag or strongly typed views.
- **Lightweight:** ViewData is lightweight because it’s just a dictionary and doesn’t require any extra classes or interfaces.
- **Dynamic:** ViewData is a dynamic object, so you can use it to pass any data.
