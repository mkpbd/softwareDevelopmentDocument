##### **How do you Pass Data to Views in ASP.NET Core MVC?**

In ASP.NET Core MVC Applications, we can pass the data from a controller action method to a view in many different ways, such as by using [**ViewBag**](https://dotnettutorials.net/lesson/viewbag-asp-net-core-mvc/), [**ViewData**](https://dotnettutorials.net/lesson/viewdata-asp-net-core-mvc/), [**TempData**](https://dotnettutorials.net/lesson/tempdata-in-asp-net-core-mvc/), and a [**Strongly Typed Model**](https://dotnettutorials.net/lesson/strongly-typed-view-asp-net-core-mvc/). In this article, I will show you how to use ViewData to pass the data from the controller action method to a view. The other three techniques, i.e., ViewBag, Tempdate, and Strongly Typed View Model, will be discussed in our upcoming articles.


##### **What is ViewData in ASP.NET Core MVC Application?**

ViewData is a dictionary object in ASP.NET Core MVC that allows us to pass data from a controller action method to a view. It provides a flexible way to pass data, allowing us to use key-value pairs. ViewData is useful when we need to pass dynamic data or data that doesn’t fit well into a strongly typed model. If you go to the definition of ViewData, you will see that It is a property in the Controller abstract class, and its type is **ViewDataDictionary**. This property is also decorated with the ViewDataDictionary attribute, as shown in the image below.

![[Pasted image 20250325124411.png]]

![[ViewData-in-ASP.NET-Core-MVC.webp]]

The ViewDataDictionary class implements the IDictionary. So, **ViewData in ASP.NET Core MVC** is a dictionary object. As a dictionary object, it stores data in the form of Key-Value Pairs, where each key must be a string, and the value that we pass to the dictionary will be stored as an **object type**.

##### **How do you use ViewData in the ASP.NET Core MVC Application?**

To use ViewData in the ASP.NET Core MVC Application, we need to set the data in a controller by adding entries to the ViewData dictionary with a string key and then assign some data. The key should be in string format, and you can give any name to the key. Then, you can assign any data to this key, such as the following.  
**ViewData[“KeyName”] = “Some Data”;**

Since ViewData is a server-side code, hence to use it on a view, we need to use the razor syntax, i.e., @ something as follows.  
**@ViewData[“KeyName”]**

##### **How to Access Student Data** **using ViewData in ASP.NET Core MVC**
![[accessing-student-data-from-viewdata-in-asp-net-co.webp]]

##### **Understand ViewData in ASP.NET Core MVC Application:**

Let us see an example of using ViewData to pass data from a controller action method to a view. In our example, we want to pass three pieces of information from the controller action method to the view. One is the Page’s title, the second is the page’s Header, and the third is the Student data.

So, first, create an ASP.NET Core Web Application (with the name **FirstCoreMVCWebApplication**) with MVC (Model-View-Controller) Project Template, i.e., Creating ASP.NET Core Application using ASP.NET Core Web APP (Model-View-Controller) Template. Once you create the project, add a class file named **Student.cs** in the Models folder. Then, please copy and paste the code below into it.

```C#
namespace FirstCoreMVCWebApplication.Models
{
    public class Student
    {
        public int StudentId { get; set; }
        public string? Name { get; set; }
        public string? Branch { get; set; }
        public string? Section { get; set; }
        public string? Gender { get; set; }
    }
}
```

##### **Modifying HomeController:**

Next, modify the Home Controller class as shown below. Here, we remove the existing code and add one action method, i.e., Details. As part of this method, we create three ViewData objects to store the Title, Header, and Student data. Here, Title, Header, and Student are the keys of the ViewData Dictionary Object.

```C#
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using FirstCoreMVCWebApplication.Models;

namespace FirstCoreMVCWebApplication.Controllers
{
    public class HomeController : Controller
    {
        public ViewResult Details()
        {
            //String string Data
            ViewData["Title"] = "Student Details Page";
            ViewData["Header"] = "Student Details";

            Student student = new Student()
            {
                StudentId = 101,
                Name = "James",
                Branch = "CSE",
                Section = "A",
                Gender = "Male"
            };

            //storing Student Data
            ViewData["Student"] = student;

            return View();
        }
    }
}
```

##### **Creating Details.cshtml View:**

In our previous article, we discussed the different ways to create Views in ASP.NET Core MVC Applications. Let us add a view named **Details.cshtml** within the **Home** folder, which is inside the **Views** folder, as shown below. Once you add the Details view, your Views folder structure should look as shown below.
![[DotNet/DotnetCoreMVC/Images/word-image-50.webp]]

Now open the **Details.cshtml** view and copy and paste the following code. As you can see in the code below, we directly access the string data from the ViewData without type casting. However, while accessing the Student data from the ViewData, we typecast it to the appropriate Student type.

```C#
@{
    Layout = null;
}

<!DOCTYPE html>

<html>
<head>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />
    <title>@ViewData["Title"]</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>@ViewData["Header"]</h1>

    @{
        var student = ViewData["Student"] as FirstCoreMVCWebApplication.Models.Student;
    }

    <div>
        StudentId : @student?.StudentId
    </div>
    <div>
        Name : @student?.Name
    </div>
    <div>
        Branch : @student?.Branch
    </div>
    <div>
        Section : @student?.Section
    </div>
    <div>
        Gender : @student?.Gender
    </div>
</body>
</html>
```

Now run the application and navigate to the “**/Home/Details**” URL. As shown below, you will see the data as expected.

![[ViewData-in-ASP.NET-Core-MVC-1.webp]]
##### **Features of ViewData in ASP.NET Core MVC:**

- **Type Safety:** ViewData does not provide type safety as it stores data as an object. You need to cast the data to the appropriate type when retrieving it.
- **Scope:** The data in ViewData only lasts for the duration of the current HTTP request. It’s reset for each new request, so it is not a mechanism for persisting data between requests, such as across redirects.
- **Accessing Data:** You can set data in a controller by adding entries to the ViewData dictionary with a string key. In the view, you can access these values using the same key. When used in the view, the values must be cast to the appropriate type.
- **Null Handling:** ViewData returns null if a key does not exist, so you should check for null or use the ?. operator to avoid exceptions.
- **Usage:** ViewData is best used to pass small amounts of data. If you’re passing complex data or require type safety, consider using ViewBag or strongly typed views.
- **Lightweight:** ViewData is lightweight because it’s just a dictionary and doesn’t require any extra classes or interfaces.
- **Dynamic:** ViewData is a dynamic object, so you can use it to pass any data.




## **ViewBag in ASP.NET Core MVC Application**

In ASP.NET Core MVC, ViewBag is a dynamic object that provides a way to pass data from the controller action method to the view. It allows us to create properties dynamically on the fly and add properties to the ViewBag object in the controller actions, which are then accessible in the Razor views. ViewBag is useful for passing simple data (e.g., strings, dates) that do not require a strongly typed view model. If you go to the Controller abstract class, you will find the following signature of the ViewBag property.

![[ViewBag-in-ASP.NET-Core-MVC.webp]]

##### **How Do We Pass and Retrieve Data from ViewBag in ASP.NET Core MVC?**

So, when we set a property on ViewBag in a controller action, like **ViewBag.Header= “Student Details”;** DynamicViewData internally adds or updates a property with the name **“Header”** and the value **“Student Details”** like **dynamic Header = “Student Details”.** Based on the right-hand side value, the data type will be decided at runtime. For example, if the value is a string, the data type will be considered a string at runtime.

In a Razor view file (.cshtml), we can access the properties set in ViewBag directly using the @ symbol followed by the property name (**@ViewBag**.**Header** ). This dynamic access is possible because ViewBag is of type dynamic.

###### **How to Access Data from ViewBag in ASP.NET Core MVC with String Type:**

![[c-users-pranaya-pictures-viewbag-with-string-type.webp]]


```c#
using FirstCoreMVCWebApplication.Models;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
namespace FirstCoreMVCWebApplication.Controllers
{
    public class HomeController : Controller
    {
        public ViewResult Details()
        {
            ViewBag.Title = "Student Details Page";
            ViewBag.Header = "Student Details";
            Student student = new Student()
            {
                StudentId = 101,
                Name = "James",
                Branch = "CSE",
                Section = "A",
                Gender = "Male"
            };

            ViewBag.Student = student;

            return View();
        }
    }
}
```

##### **Accessing ViewBag in a View in ASP.NET Core**

```c#
@{
    Layout = null;
    var student = ViewBag.Student;
}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>@ViewBag.Title</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>@ViewBag.Header</h1>
    <div>
        StudentId : @student?.StudentId
    </div>
    <div>
        Name : @student?.Name
    </div>
    <div>
        Branch : @student?.Branch
    </div>
    <div>
        Section : @student?.Section
    </div>
    <div>
        Gender : @student?.Gender
    </div>
</body>
</html>
```

# Strongly Typed View in ASP.NET Core MVC

##### **Why do we need a Strongly Typed View in ASP.NET Core MVC?**

As we already discussed, in ASP.NET Core MVC, we can pass the model data to a view using many different methods, such as ViewBag, ViewData, TempData, Strongly Typed View Model, etc. The view becomes loosely typed when we pass the model data to a View using ViewBag, TempData, or ViewData. We will not get intellisence support or compile-time error checking in a loosely typed view. With a Strongly Typed View, we will get the following benefits:

- **Type Safety:** By specifying the model type, we get compile-time type checking, which helps prevent runtime errors due to type mismatches. With a strongly typed view, the compiler checks that the view is using properties and methods that exist on the view model class.
- **Intellisense Support:** IDEs like Visual Studio provide intellisense for the model properties, which provides auto-completion of model property names, improving development speed and reducing errors.
- **Refactoring Support:** Refactoring becomes easier and safer; for example, renaming a property on a model will automatically indicate places in views where changes are needed.

##### **How Do We Create Strongly Typed Views in ASP.NET Core MVC?**

To create a strongly typed view in ASP.NET Core MVC, we need to follow the below steps:

1. **Create a Model:** Define a model class representing the data you want to display in the view. This class contains properties corresponding to the data you need to access and render in the view.
2. **Pass the Model to the View:** In the controller action method, create an instance of the model class, populate it with data, and then pass it to the view.
3. **Declare the Model in the View:** At the top of the view file, declare the model type using the **@model** directive. This informs the view about the type of data it will be working with.
4. **Access Model Properties in the View:** You can access the model’s properties inside the view using Razor syntax (**@Model.PropertyName**). Here, you will get the intellisence support for the model properties.

##### **Example to Understand Strongly Typed View in ASP.NET Core MVC Application**

##### **Create a Model**

First, you need to define a model class. A model is a C# class with properties. This class will be used to transfer data between your controller and view. We will use the same application we used in our previous two articles. So, we are going to use the same Student model. If you are coming to this article directly without reading our previous two articles, then please create the following Student class within the Models folder:


```c#
namespace FirstCoreMVCWebApplication.Models
{
    public class Student
    {
        public int StudentId { get; set; }
        public string? Name { get; set; }
        public string? Branch { get; set; }
        public string? Section { get; set; }
        public string? Gender { get; set; }
    }
}
```


![[c-users-pranaya-pictures-strongly-typed-view-in-a.webp]]

```c#
using FirstCoreMVCWebApplication.Models;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
namespace FirstCoreMVCWebApplication.Controllers
{
    public class HomeController : Controller
    {
        public ViewResult Details()
        {
            //Using ViewBag
            ViewBag.Title = "Student Details Page";

            //Using ViewData
            ViewData["Header"] = "Student Details";

            //Creating Student Object to Hold Student data
            Student student = new Student()
            {
                StudentId = 101,
                Name = "James",
                Branch = "CSE",
                Section = "A",
                Gender = "Male"
            };

            //Passing the Model Object as a Parameter to View Extension Method
            //It means the View is going to be a Strongly Type View for the Student Model
            return View(student);
        }
    }
}
```

```c#
@{
    Layout = null;
}
<!DOCTYPE html>
@model FirstCoreMVCWebApplication.Models.Student

<html>
<head>
    <title>@ViewBag.Title</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>@ViewData["Header"]</h1>
    <div>
        StudentId : @Model?.StudentId
    </div>
    <div>
        Name : @Model?.Name
    </div>
    <div>
        Branch : @Model?.Branch
    </div>
    <div>
        Section : @Model?.Section
    </div>
    <div>
        Gender : @Model?.Gender
    </div>
</body>
</html>
```

## **ViewModel in ASP.NET Core MVC Application**

##### **What is a ViewModel in ASP.NET Core MVC?**

A View Model in ASP.NET Core MVC is a class that represents the data and logic required by a view. It is specifically designed to serve the needs of the user interface and does not necessarily map directly to the domain model or database entities. The primary purpose of a View Model is to encapsulate all the data that the view needs to render, making it easier to pass this data from the controller to the view. It acts as an intermediary between the controller and the view, encapsulating the data displayed or edited on the view.

In Real-Time Applications, a single model object may not contain all the data required for a view. We must use a View Model in the ASP.NET Core MVC application in such situations. In simple words, a View Model in ASP.NET Core MVC is a model that contains more than one model data required for a particular view.

##### **How Do We Implement the View Model in an ASP.NET Core Application?**

To implement a view model in ASP.NET Core MVC, follow these steps:

- **Define the View Model:** Create a class that includes properties relevant to the view’s needs.
- **Populate the View Model in the Controller:** In your controller, populate the view model from the domain model or other data sources.
- **Pass the View Model to the View:** Pass the populated view model to the view from the controller using the View overloaded method, which takes the model object as a parameter.
- **Use the View Model in the View:** Access the view model’s properties in the view using Razor syntax.

Let us understand the View Model in ASP.NET Core MVC with an Example. The following diagram shows the visual representation of a view model in the ASP.NET Core MVC application.

![[c-users-pranaya-pictures-view-model-representatio.webp]]

##### **Creating the Required Models:**

We will use the same example that we have been worked so far. First, modify the **Student.cs** class file, which is present within the Models folder of your application, as follows. This model will represent a student’s basic information, such as a **Name, Branch, Section**, etc.


```C#
namespace FirstCoreMVCWebApplication.Models
{
    public class Student
    {
        public int StudentId { get; set; }
        public string? Name { get; set; }
        public string? Branch { get; set; }
        public string? Section { get; set; }
        public string? Gender { get; set; }
    }
}

namespace FirstCoreMVCWebApplication.Models
{
    public class Address
    {
        public int StudentId { get; set; }
        public string? City { get; set; }
        public string? State { get; set; }
        public string? Country { get; set; }
        public string? Pin { get; set; }
    }
}



```

##### **Creating the View Model:**

Now, create the View Model to store the data required for a particular view. In our case, it’s the student’s Details view. This View Model will represent the Student Model + Student Address Model + some additional data like Page Titles and Headers.

You can create the View Models anywhere in your application, but it is recommended to create all the View Models within a folder called **ViewModels** to keep things organized. So first, create a folder at the root directory of your application with the name **ViewModels,** and then create a class file with the name **StudentDetailsViewModel.cs** within the **ViewModels** folder. Copy and paste the following code once you create the **StudentDetailsViewModel.cs** class file.

```c#
using FirstCoreMVCWebApplication.Models;

namespace FirstCoreMVCWebApplication.ViewModels
{
    public class StudentDetailsViewModel
    {
        public Student? Student { get; set; }
        public Address? Address { get; set; }
        public string? Title { get; set; }
        public string? Header { get; set; }
    }
}
```

##### **Creating Student Controller:**

```c#
using FirstCoreMVCWebApplication.Models;
using FirstCoreMVCWebApplication.ViewModels;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;

namespace FirstCoreMVCWebApplication.Controllers
{
    public class StudentController : Controller
    {
        public ViewResult Details()
        {
            //Student Basic Details
            Student student = new Student()
            {
                StudentId = 101,
                Name = "Dillip",
                Branch = "CSE",
                Section = "A",
                Gender = "Male"
            };

            //Student Address
            Address address = new Address()
            {
                StudentId = 101,
                City = "Mumbai",
                State = "Maharashtra",
                Country = "India",
                Pin = "400097"
            };

            //Creating the View model
            StudentDetailsViewModel studentDetailsViewModel = new StudentDetailsViewModel()
            {
                Student = student,
                Address = address,
                Title = "Student Details Page",
                Header = "Student Details",
            };

            //Pass the studentDetailsViewModel to the view
            return View(studentDetailsViewModel);
        }
    }
}
```


##### **Creating the Details View:**

```c#
@model FirstCoreMVCWebApplication.ViewModels.StudentDetailsViewModel
@{
    Layout = null;
}
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<head>
    <title>@Model?.Title</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>@Model?.Header</h1>
    <div>
        StudentId : @Model?.Student?.StudentId
    </div>
    <div>
        Name : @Model?.Student?.Name
    </div>
    <div>
        Branch : @Model?.Student?.Branch
    </div>
    <div>
        Section : @Model?.Student?.Section
    </div>
    <div>
        Gender : @Model?.Student?.Gender
    </div>

    <h1>Student Address</h1>
    <div>
        City : @Model?.Address?.City
    </div>
    <div>
        State : @Model?.Address?.State
    </div>
    <div>
        Country : @Model?.Address?.Country
    </div>
    <div>
        Pin : @Model?.Address?.Pin
    </div>
</body>
</html>
```

##### **Benefits of View Model in ASP.NET Core MVC:**

With View Model in ASP.NET Core MVC, we will get the following benefits:

- **Strongly Typed:** Unlike ViewData or ViewBag, which are dynamic and loosely typed, a ViewModel is a strongly typed object. This means it has a specific, predefined structure with properties of defined types. This strong typing ensures compile-time type checking, reducing the risk of runtime errors and making the codebase more robust and maintainable.
- **Separation of Concerns:** View models separate the presentation layer from the business logic and data access layers. This means views are not dependent on the database schema or domain logic, promoting cleaner and more maintainable code.
- **UI Customization:** They allow customization of the data presentation for specific views without impacting the underlying data models.
- **Data Aggregation:** View models can aggregate data from multiple domain models or services into a single object that is easy for the view to consume.
- **Security:** Using view models can improve security by ensuring that only the necessary data is exposed to the view. It prevents over-posting attacks where users could potentially submit additional, unwanted fields through form submissions.
- **Optimized Data Loading:** View models can help optimize data transfers between the server and client by including only the data necessary for the view, reducing payload sizes and load times.
