##### **What is LINQ?**

Microsoft introduced LINQ (Language Integrated Query) with .NET Framework 3.5 and C# 3.0, available in the **System.Linq** namespace. LINQ provides a common syntax that allows us to query the data from various data sources in a uniform manner.

##### **How Does LINQ Work?**

![[Pasted image 20240520165354.png]]

##### **What are LINQ Providers?**

LINQ (Language Integrated Query) providers are components that enable querying against a specific data source using the LINQ syntax in .NET. LINQ providers are components or libraries responsible for translating LINQ queries into a format that the underlying data sources can execute.

- **Translation of LINQ Queries:** LINQ providers translate LINQ queries into the native query language of the data source. For example, a LINQ provider for SQL Server translates LINQ queries into T-SQL queries.
- **Different Providers for Different Data Sources:** Different LINQ providers exist for different data sources. Some common ones include:
    - - **LINQ to Objects:** Used for querying in-memory collections like arrays or lists.
        - **LINQ to SQL (DLinq):** Used for querying SQL Server databases.
        - **LINQ to Entities (Entity Framework):** Used for querying databases via the Entity Framework, which supports multiple database types.
        - **LINQ to XML (XLinq):** Used for querying XML documents.
- **Custom Providers:** Developers can create custom LINQ providers to enable LINQ querying over custom data sources, like a proprietary database or a unique data format.
- **Execution of Queries:** The LINQ provider executes the query against the data source and returns the results. This execution can involve translating the query into a different format, executing it, and then materializing the results back into .NET objects.
- **Performance Considerations:** The efficiency of LINQ queries can depend heavily on the specific LINQ provider used, as different providers have different ways of translating and executing queries.

##### **Different Ways to Write LINQ Queries in C#:**

**Query Syntax:** It is similar to SQL and is often more readable for those familiar with SQL. It starts with a from clause followed by a range variable and includes standard query operations like where, select, group, join, etc.

```c#
var query = from c in customers
            where c.City == "London"
            select c.Name;
```
**Method Syntax (Fluent Syntax):** It uses extension methods and lambda expressions. It can be more concise and is preferred when writing complex queries because it can be easier to read and compose.
```c#
var query = customers.Where(c => c.City == "London").Select(c => c.Name);
```


##### **LINQ Query Syntax:**

###### **Characteristics:**

- Resembles SQL-like declarative style.
- It can be more readable, especially for those familiar with SQL.
- Not all operations can be expressed in Query Syntax; some require a switch to Method Syntax.

##### **LINQ Method Syntax:**
![[Pasted image 20240520165647.png]]
- Utilizes lambda expressions.
- It can be more concise for complex queries.
- Offers slightly more methods and flexibility than Query Syntax.
- It can be easier to understand for those familiar with lambda expressions and functional programming.
##### **LINQ Mixed Syntax:**

You can also mix both syntaxes, although this is less common. This is the combination of both Query and Method syntax. The syntax is given below.

##### **Comparison Between Method and Query Syntax:**

- **Interchangeability:** Most queries can be written in either syntax, and it often comes down to personal or team preference.
- **Performance:** There is no performance difference between the two, as Query Syntax is translated into Method Syntax at compile time.
- **Complexity:** For more complex queries, Method Syntax can be more powerful and flexible, but Query Syntax can be more intuitive for simpler queries or for those with a background in SQL.

**Example Using LINQ Query Syntax in C#:**

```c#
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
namespace LINQDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            //Step1: Data Source
            List<int> integerList = new List<int>()
            {
                1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
            };

            //Step2: Query
            //LINQ Query using Query Syntax to fetch all numbers which are > 5
            var QuerySyntax = from obj in integerList //Data Source
                              where obj > 5 //Condition
                              select obj; //Selection

            //Step3: Execution
            foreach (var item in QuerySyntax)
            {
                Console.Write(item + " ");
            }

            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}
```

**Example Using LINQ Method Syntax in C#:**

```c#
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
namespace LINQDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            //Step1: Data Source
            List<int> integerList = new List<int>()
            {
                1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
            };

            //Step2: Query
            //LINQ Query using Query Syntax to fetch all numbers which are > 5
            var QuerySyntax = integerList.Where(obj => obj > 5).ToList(); 

            //Step3: Execution
            foreach (var item in QuerySyntax)
            {
                Console.Write(item + " ");
            }

            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}
```

###### **Example Using LINQ Mixed Syntax in C#:**

Let us change our requirements. First, we need to filter the list where the value is greater than 5, and then we need to calculate the sum.

```C#
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;

namespace LINQDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            //Data Source
            List<int> integerList = new List<int>()
            {
                1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
            };

            //LINQ Query using Mixed Syntax
            var MethodSyntax = (from obj in integerList
                                where obj > 5
                                select obj).Sum();

            //Execution
            Console.Write("Sum Is : " + MethodSyntax);
            
            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}
```

            }

            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}

##### **What is IEnumerable in C#?**

IEnumerable in C# is an interface that defines one method, GetEnumerator, which returns an IEnumerator object. This interface is found in the **System.Collections** namespace. It is a key part of the .NET Framework and is used to iterate over a collection of objects. The following is the definition of the IEnumerator interface.

![[Pasted image 20240520190207.png]]
###### **GetEnumerator Method:**

This is the only method defined in the IEnumerable interface. It returns an IEnumerator object, which provides the ability to iterate through the collection by exposing a Current property and MoveNext() and Reset() methods.

- **Current**: A property that gets the current element in the collection.
- **MoveNext()**: This advances the enumerator to the next element of the collection.
- **Reset():** Sets the enumerator to its initial position, which is before the first element in the collection.

IEnumerable is typically used with a foreach loop in C#. The foreach loop automatically uses the GetEnumerator method and the IEnumerator object to iterate over the elements of the collection. 

##### **Key Characteristic of IEnumerator in C#:**

- **Purpose:** It provides a simple iteration over a collection of a specified type. It’s primarily used for in-memory collections like arrays, lists, etc.
- **Execution:** When you use LINQ methods on an IEnumerable, the query is executed in the client’s memory. This means all the data is loaded into memory from the data source (like a database), and the operation is performed.
- **Methods:** The extension methods for IEnumerable are defined in the System.Linq.Enumerable class.
- **Deferred Execution:** It supports deferred execution, but the query logic is executed locally on the client side.
- **Use Case:** Best suited for working with in-memory data where the dataset is not too large.

##### **Example to understand IEnumerable with Complex Type using C#:**

```c#
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;

namespace LINQDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            List<Student> studentList = new List<Student>()
            {
                new Student(){ID = 1, Name = "James", Gender = "Male"},
                new Student(){ID = 2, Name = "Sara", Gender = "Female"},
                new Student(){ID = 3, Name = "Steve", Gender = "Male"},
                new Student(){ID = 4, Name = "Pam", Gender = "Female"}
            };

            //Linq Query to Fetch all students with Gender Male
            IEnumerable<Student> QuerySyntax = from std in studentList
                                               where std.Gender == "Male"
                                               select std;
            //Iterate through the collection
            foreach (var student in QuerySyntax)
            {
                Console.WriteLine( $"ID : {student.ID}  Name : {student.Name}");
            }

            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }

    public class Student
    {
        public int ID { get; set; }
        public string Name { get; set; }
        public string Gender { get; set; }
    }
}
```


##### **What is IQueryable in C#?**

IQueryable in C# is an interface that is used to query data from a data source. It is part of the System.Linq namespace and is a key component in LINQ (Language Integrated Query). Unlike IEnumerable, which is used for iterating over in-memory collections, IQueryable is designed for querying data sources where the query is not executed until the object is enumerated. This is particularly useful for remote data sources, like databases, enabling efficient querying by allowing the query to be executed on the server side. The following is the definition of the IQueryable interface.

![[Pasted image 20240520190412.png]]
- **Deferred Execution:** IQueryable defers the execution of the query until the queryable object is actually iterated over. This means the query is not executed when defined but when the results are required.
- **Expression Trees:** IQueryable queries are represented as expression trees. An expression tree is a data structure that represents code in a tree-like format, where each node is an expression, such as a method call or a binary operation. This allows the query to be translated into a format that can be understood by the data source, such as SQL for a database.
- **Query Providers:** IQueryable relies on an implementation of the IQueryProvider interface to execute queries. The provider translates the expression tree into a format that can be executed against the data source.

##### **Key Characteristic of IQueryable in C#:**

- **Purpose:** It is intended to query data from out-of-memory sources, like a database or web service. It is a powerful feature for LINQ, SQL, and Entity Framework.
- **Execution:** The query logic is translated into a format suitable for the data source (like SQL for a relational database). The query is executed on the server side, which can improve performance and reduce network traffic.
- **Methods:** The extension methods for IQueryable are defined in the System.Linq.Queryable class.
- **Deferred Execution:** Supports deferred execution, and the query is executed in the data source (like a database).
- **Use Case:** This is ideal for remote data sources, like databases, where you want to leverage server-side resources and minimize data transfer.

            {
                new Student(){ID = 1, Name = "James", Gender = "Male"},

            };
            
            //Linq Query to Fetch all students with Gender Male
            IQueryable<Student> MethodSyntax = studentList.AsQueryable()
                                .Where(std => std.Gender == "Male");
                                              
            //Iterate through the collection
            foreach (var student in MethodSyntax)
            {
                Console.WriteLine( $"ID : {student.ID}  Name : {student.Name}");
            }
