The Onion architecture was first introduced by Jeffrey Palermo, to overcome the issues of the traditional N-layered architecture approach.
There are multiple ways that we can split the onion, but we are going to choose the following approach where we are going to split the architecture into 4 layers:
1 Domain Layer
2 Service Layer
3 Infrastructure Layer
4 Presentation Layer

Conceptually, we can consider that the Infrastructure and Presentation layers are on the same level of the hierarchy.
Now, let us go ahead and look at each layer with more detail to see why we are introducing it and what we are going to create inside of that layer:

We can see all the different layers that we are going to build in our project.

## Advantages of Onion architecture
All of the layers interact with each other strictly through the interfaces defined in the layers below. The flow of dependencies is towards the core of the Onion. We will explain why this is important in the next section.

Using dependency inversion throughout the project, depending on abstractions (interfaces) and not the implementations, allows us to switch out the implementation at runtime transparently. We are depending on abstractions at compile-time, which gives us strict contracts to work with, and we are being provided with the implementation at runtime.

Testability is very high with the Onion architecture because everything depends on abstractions. The abstractions can be easily mocked with a mocking library such as Moq. We can write business logic without concern about any of the implementation details. If we need anything from an external system or service, we can just create an interface for it and consume it. We do not have to worry about how it will be implemented. The higher layers of the Onion will take care of implementing that interface transparently.

## Flow of Dependencies

The main idea behind the Onion architecture is the flow of dependencies, or rather how the layers interact with each other. The deeper the layer resides inside the Onion, the fewer dependencies it has.

#### The Domain layer does not have any direct dependencies on the outside layers. It is isolated, in a way, from the outside world. The outer layers are all allowed to reference the layers that are directly below them in the hierarchy.

#### We can conclude that all the dependencies in the Onion architecture flow inwards. But we should ask ourselves, why is this important?
#### The flow of dependencies dictates what a certain layer in the Onion architecture can do. Because it depends on the layers below it in the hierarchy, it can only call the methods that are exposed by the lower layers.
#### We can use lower layers of the Onion architecture to define contracts or interfaces. The outer layers of the architecture implement these interfaces. This means that in the Domain layer, we are not concerning ourselves with infrastructure details such as the database or external services



#### Using this approach, we can encapsulate all of the rich business logic in the Domain and Service layers without ever having to know any implementation details. In the Service layer, we are going to depend only on the interfaces that are defined by the layer below, which is the Domain layer.
#### So, after all the theory, we can continue with our project implementation. Letâ€™s start with the models and the ==Entities== project.


## Creating  Models 
Using the example from the second chapter of this book, we are going to extract a new Class Library project named ==Entities==.

Inside it, we are going to create a folder named Models, which will contain all the model classes (entities). Entities represent classes that Entity Framework Core uses to map our database model with the tables from the database. The properties from entity classes will be mapped to the database columns.
