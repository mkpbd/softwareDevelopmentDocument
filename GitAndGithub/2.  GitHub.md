## GitHub Account

Go to [GitHub](https://www.github.com/) and sign up for an account:

**Note:** Remember to use the same e-mail address you used in the Git config.

We will go over the different options and what they mean later. But for now, choose Public (if you want the repo to be viewable for anyone) or Private (if you want to choose who should be able to view the repo). Either way, you will be able to choose who can **contribute** to the repo.

Then click "Create repository".

![[Pasted image 20240416200456.png]]

Copy the URL, or click the clipboard marked in the image above.

Now paste it the following command:

``` git
git remote add origin https://github.com/w3schools-test/hello-world.git
```
`git remote add origin _URL_` specifies that you are adding a remote repository, with the specified `URL`, as an `origin` to your local Git repo.

Now we are going to push our master branch to the origin url, and set it as the default remote branch:

`git push --set-upstream origin master`

**Note:** Since this is the first time you are connecting to GitHub, you will get some kind of notification you to authenticate this connection.

# Git GitHub Edit Code

## Edit Code in GitHub

In addition to being a host for Git content, GitHub has a very good code editor.

Let's try to edit the `README.md` file in GitHub. Just click the edit button:

# Git Pull from GitHub

## Pulling to Keep up-to-date with Changes

When working as a team on a project, it is important that everyone stays up to date.

Any time you start working on a project, you should get the most recent changes to your local copy.

With Git, you can do that with `pull`.

`pull` is a combination of 2 different commands:

- `fetch`
- `merge`

Let's take a closer look into how `fetch`, `merge`, and `pull` works.

## Git Fetch

`fetch` gets all the change history of a tracked branch/repo.

So, on your local Git, `fetch` updates to see what has changed on GitHub:

`git fetch origin`

Now that we have the recent `changes`, we can check our `status`:

`git status`

We are behind the `origin/master` by 1 `commit`. That should be the updated `README.md`, but lets double check by viewing the `log`:

`git log origin/master`

`git diff origin/master`

That looks precisely as expected! Now we can safely `merge`.
## Git Merge

`merge` combines the current branch, with a specified branch.

We have confirmed that the updates are as expected, and we can merge our current branch (`master`) with `origin/master`:

`git merge origin/master`

Check our `status` again to confirm we are up to date:

## Git Pull

But what if you just want to update your local repository, without going through all those steps?

`pull` is a combination of `fetch` and `merge`. It is used to pull all changes from a remote repository into the branch you are working on.

Make another change to the Readme.md file on GitHub.
![[Pasted image 20240416201002.png]]

Use `pull` to update our local Git:

`git pull origin`

# Git Push to GitHub

## Push Changes to GitHub

Let's try making some changes to our local git and pushing them to GitHub.

`git commit -a -m "Updated index.html. Resized image"`

`git status`

Now push our changes to our remote origin:
`git push origin`

# Git GitHub Branch

## Create a New Branch on GitHub

On GitHub, access your repository and click the "master" branch button.

There you can create a new Branch. Type in a descriptive name, and click Create branch:

![[Pasted image 20240416201221.png]]
The `branch` should now be created and active. You can confirm which branch you are working on by looking at the branch button. See that it now says "html-skeleton" instead of "main"?
![[Pasted image 20240416201244.png]]

Start working on an existing file in this branch. Click the "`index.html`" file and start editing:

![[Pasted image 20240416201256.png]]

# Git Pull Branch from GitHub

## Pulling a Branch from GitHub

Now continue working on our new `branch` in our local Git.

Lets `pull` from our GitHub repository again so that our code is up-to-date:

`git pull`

Now our main `branch` is up todate. And we can see that there is a new `branch` available on GitHub.

Do a quick `status` check:
`git status`
And confirm which branches we have, and where we are working at the moment:

`git branch * master`
So, we do not have the new `branch` on our local Git. But we know it is available on GitHub. So we can use the `-a` option to see all local and remote branches:

```git
git branch -a * master 
remotes/origin/html-skeleton 
remotes/origin/master
```
**Note:** `branch -r` is for remote branches only.

`git pull`

## Push a Branch to GitHub

Let's try to create a new local branch, and push that to GitHub.

Start by creating a branch, like we did earlier:

`git checkout -b update-readme`
`git add read.md`
`git commit -m "this is a comment "`
`git push origin update-readme`

Go to GitHub, and confirm that the repository has a new `branch`:

![[Pasted image 20240416201821.png]]


In GitHub, we can now see the changes and `merge` them into the master `branch` if we approve it.

If you click the "Compare & pull request", you can go through the changes made and new files added:

![[Pasted image 20240416201843.png]]
**Note:** This comparison shows both the changes from `update-readme` and `html-skeleton` because we created the new branch FROM `html-skeleton`.

![[Pasted image 20240416201900.png]]

A pull request is how you propose changes. You can ask some to review your changes or pull your contribution and merge it into their branch.

Since this is your own repository, you can  `merge` your pull request yourself:
![[Pasted image 20240416201918.png]]

The pull request will record the changes, which means you can go through them later to figure out the changes made.

The result should be something like this:

![[Pasted image 20240416201930.png]]

An after you confirm that the changes from the previous branch were included, delete that as well:

## Working using the GitHub Flow

On this page, you will learn how to get the best out of working with GitHub.

The GitHub flow is a workflow designed to work well with Git and GitHub.

It focuses on branching and makes it possible for teams to experiment freely, and make deployments regularly.

The GitHub flow works like this:

- Create a new Branch
- Make changes and add Commits
- Open a Pull Request
- Review
- Deploy
- Merge

You should already have a good understanding of how this works from the previous chapters. This chapter focuses on understanding how the flow makes it easy for you to work together.
