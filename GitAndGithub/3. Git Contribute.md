## Fork a Repository

A `fork` is a copy of a repository. This is useful when you want to contribute to someone else's project or start your own project based on theirs.

`fork` is not a command in Git, but something offered in GitHub and other repository hosts. Let's start by logging in to GitHub, and `fork`  repository:

# Git Clone from GitHub

Now we have our own `fork`, but only on GitHub. We also want a `clone` on our local Git to keep working on it.

A `clone` is a full copy of a repository, including all logging and versions of files.

Move back to the **original** repository, and click the green "Code" button to get the `URL` to `clone`:

Open your Git bash and `clone` the repository:
`git clone https://github.com/w3schools-test/w3schools-test.github.io.git`

**Note:** To specify a specific folder to clone to, add the name of the folder after the repository `URL`, like this: `git clone https://github.com/w3schools-test/w3schools-test.github.io.git _myfolder_`

## Configuring Remotes

Basically, we have a full copy of a repository, whose `origin` we are not allowed to make changes to.

Let's see how the `remotes` of this Git is set up:

```git 
git remote -v origin https://github.com/w3schools-test/w3schools-test.github.io.git (fetch) origin https://github.com/w3schools-test/w3schools-test.github.io.git (push)
```

We see that `origin` is set up to the original "`w3schools-test`" repository, we also want to add our own `fork`.

First, we `rename` the original `origin` `remote`:

```git
git remote rename origin upstream git remote -v upstream https://github.com/w3schools-test/w3schools-test.github.io.git (fetch) upstream https://github.com/w3schools-test/w3schools-test.github.io.git (push)
```
Then fetch the `URL` of our own `fork`:

![[Pasted image 20240416202505.png]]

And add that as `origin`:

```git
git remote add origin https://github.com/kaijim/w3schools-test.github.io.git git remote -v origin https://github.com/kaijim/w3schools-test.github.io.git (fetch) origin https://github.com/kaijim/w3schools-test.github.io.git (push) upstream https://github.com/w3schools-test/w3schools-test.github.io.git (fetch) upstream https://github.com/w3schools-test/w3schools-test.github.io.git (push)
```
**Note:** According to Git naming conventions, it is recommended to name your own repository `origin`, and the one you forked for `upstream`

Now we have 2 remotes:

- `origin` - our own `fork`, where we have read and write access
- `upstream` - the original, where we have read-only access

Now we are going to make some changes to the code. In the next chapter, we will cover how we suggest those changes to the original repository.


## Push Changes to Our GitHub Fork

We have made a lot of changes to our local Git.

Now we `push` them to our GitHub `fork`:

`commit` the changes:

`git push origin`

Click that and create a pull request:

## Approving Pull Requests

Now any member with access can see the Pull Request when they see the original repository:
![[Pasted image 20240416202802.png]]
And they can see the proposed changes:
![[Pasted image 20240416202812.png]]
Comment on the changes and `merge`:
![[Pasted image 20240416202823.png]]
Confirm:
![[Pasted image 20240416202834.png]]

And changes have been `merged` with `master`:
