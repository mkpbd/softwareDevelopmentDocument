## Git Ignore

When sharing your code with others, there are often files or parts of your project, you do not want to share.

Examples

- log files
- temporary files
- hidden files
- personal files
- etc.

Git can specify which files or parts of your project should be ignored by Git using a `.gitignore` file.

Git will not track files and folders specified in `.gitignore`. However, the `.gitignore` file itself **IS** tracked by Git.

## Create .gitignore

To create a `.gitignore` file, go to the root of your local Git, and create it:

touch .gitignore

Now open the file using a text editor.

We are just going to add two simple rules:

- Ignore any files with the `.log` extension
- Ignore everything in any directory named `temp`

```git
# ignore ALL .log files  
*.log  
  
# ignore ALL files in ANY directory named temp  
temp/
```

Now all `.log` files and anything in `temp` folders will be ignored by Git.

**Note:** In this case, we use a single `.gitignore` which applies to the entire repository.

It is also possible to have additional `.gitignore` files in subdirectories. These only apply to files or folders within that directory.

## Rules for .gitignore

Here are the general rules for matching patterns in `.gitignore` files:

|Pattern|Explanation/Matches|Examples|
|---|---|---|
||Blank lines are ignored||
|# _text comment_|Lines starting with # are ignored||
|_name_|All _name_ files, _name_ folders, and files and folders in any _name_ folder|/name.log  <br>/name/file.txt  <br>/lib/name.log|
|_name_/|Ending with / specifies the pattern is for a folder. Matches all files and folders in any _name_ folder|/name/file.txt  <br>/name/log/name.log  <br>  <br>**no match:**  <br>/name.log|
|_name_._file_|All files with the _name.file_|/name.file  <br>/lib/name.file|
|_/name_._file_|Starting with / specifies the pattern matches only files in the root folder|/name.file  <br>  <br>**no match:**  <br>/lib/name.file|
|_lib/name_._file_|Patterns specifiing files in specific folders are always realative to root (even if you do not start with / )|/lib/name.file  <br>  <br>**no match:**  <br>name.file  <br>/test/lib/name.file|
|**_/lib/name.file_|Starting with ** before / specifies that it matches any folder in the repository. Not just on root.|/lib/name.file  <br>/test/lib/name.file|
|**_/name_|All _name_ folders, and files and folders in any _name_ folder|/name/log.file  <br>/lib/name/log.file  <br>/name/lib/log.file|
|/lib/**_/name_|All _name_ folders, and files and folders in any _name_ folder within the lib folder.|/lib/name/log.file  <br>/lib/test/name/log.file  <br>/lib/test/ver1/name/log.file  <br>  <br>**no match:**  <br>/name/log.file|
|*._file_|All files withe _.file_ extention|/name.file  <br>/lib/name.file|
|*_name_/|All folders ending with _name_|/lastname/log.file  <br>/firstname/log.file|
|_name_?._file_|? matches a **single** non-specific character|/names.file  <br>/name1.file  <br>  <br>**no match:**  <br>/names1.file|
|_name_[a-z]._file_|[_range_] matches a **single** character in the specified range (in this case a character in the range of a-z, and also be numberic.)|/names.file  <br>/nameb.file  <br>  <br>**no match:**  <br>/name1.file|
|_name_[abc]._file_|[_set_] matches a **single** character in the specified set of characters (in this case either a, b, or c)|/namea.file  <br>/nameb.file  <br>  <br>**no match:**  <br>/names.file|
|_name_[!abc]._file_|[!_set_] matches a **single** character, **except** the ones spesified in the set of characters (in this case a, b, or c)|/names.file  <br>/namex.file  <br>  <br>**no match:**  <br>/namesb.file|
|*._file_|All files withe _.file_ extention|/name.file  <br>/lib/name.file|
|_name_/  <br>!_name_/secret.log|! specifies a negation or exception. Matches all files and folders in any _name_ folder, except name/secret.log|/name/file.txt  <br>/name/log/name.log  <br>  <br>**no match:**  <br>/name/secret.log|
|*._file  <br>_!_name_.file|! specifies a negation or exception. All files withe _.file_ extention, except name.file|/log.file  <br>/lastname.file  <br>  <br>**no match:**  <br>/name.file|
|*._file  <br>_!_name_/*_.file_  <br>junk.*|Adding new patterns after a negation will re-ignore a previous negated file  <br>All files withe _.file_ extention, except the ones in _name_ folder. Unless the file name is junk|/log.file  <br>/name/log.file  <br>  <br>**no match:**  <br>/name/junk.file|

# Git Security SSH

## Git Security

Up to this point, we have used HTTPS to connect to our remote repository.

HTTPS will usually work just fine, but you should use SSH if you work with unsecured networks. And sometimes, a project will require that you use SSH.

---

## What is SSH

SSH is a secure shell network protocol that is used for network management, remote file transfer, and remote system access.

SSH uses a pair of SSH keys to establish an authenticated and encrypted secure network protocol. It allows for secure remote communication on unsecured open networks.

SSH keys are used to initiate a secure "handshake". When generating a set of keys, you will generate a "public" and "private" key.

The "public" key is the one you share with the remote party. Think of this more as the lock.

The "private" key is the one you keep for yourself in a secure place. Think of this as the key to the lock.

SSH keys are generated through a security algorithm. It is all very complicated, but it uses prime numbers, and large random numbers to make the public and private key.

It is created so that the public key can be derived from the private key, but not the other way around.

## Generating an SSH Key Pair

In the command line for Linux, Apple, and in the Git Bash for Windows, you can generate an SSH key.

Let's go through it, step by step.

Start by creating a new key, using your email as a label:

```git
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "test@w3schools.com" Generating public/private rsa key pair. Enter file in which to save the key (/Users/user/.ssh/id_rsa): Created directory '/Users/user/.ssh'. Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): Enter same passphrase again: Your identification has been saved in /Users/user/.ssh/id_rsa Your public key has been saved in /Users/user/.ssh/id_rsa.pub The key fingerprint is: SHA256:******************************************* test@w3schools.com The key's randomart image is: +---[RSA 4096]----+ | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | +----[SHA256]-----+
