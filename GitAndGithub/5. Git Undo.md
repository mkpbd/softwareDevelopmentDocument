## Git Revert

`revert` is the command we use when we want to take a previous `commit` and add it as a new `commit`, keeping the `log` intact.

Step 1: Find the previous `commit`:

Step 2: Use it to make a new `commit`:

Let's make a new `commit`, where we have "accidentally" deleted a file:
```git
git commit -m "Just a regular update, definitely no accidents here..."
```

Now we have a part in our `commit` history we want to go back to. Let's try and do that with `revert`.

## Git Revert Find Commit in Log

First thing, we need to find the point we want to return to. To do that, we need to go through the `log`.

To avoid the very long log list, we are going to use the `--oneline` option, which gives just one line per commit showing:

- The first seven characters of the `commit hash`
- the `commit message`

So let's find the point we want to `revert`:

`git log --oneline`

We want to revert to the previous `commit`: `52418f7 (HEAD -> master) Just a regular update, definitely no accidents here...`, and we see that it is the latest `commit`.

## Git Revert HEAD

We revert the latest `commit` using git `revert HEAD` (`revert` the latest change,  and then `commit`), adding the option `--no-edit` to skip the commit message editor (getting the default `revert` message):

`git revert HEAD --no-edit`

Now let's check the `log` again:
`git log --oneline`

**Note:** To revert to earlier commits, use `git revert HEAD~_x_` (_`x`_ being a number. 1 going back one more, 2 going back two more, etc.)

On the next page, we'll go over `git reset`, which brings the repository back to an earlier state in the commits without making a new `commit`.

## Git Reset

`reset` is the command we use when we want to move the repository back to a previous `commit`, discarding any changes made after that `commit`.

Step 1: Find the previous `commit`:

![[img_reset_part1.gif]]
Step 2: Move the repository back to that step:
![[img_reset_part2.gif]]
After the previous chapter, we have a part in our `commit` history we could go back to. Let's try and do that with `reset`.

## Git Reset Find Commit in Log

First thing, we need to find the point we want to return to. To do that, we need to go through the `log`.

To avoid the very long `log` list, we are going to use the `--oneline` option, which gives just one line per `commit` showing:

- The first seven characters of the `commit hash` - this is what we need to refer to in our reset command.
- the `commit message`

So let's find the point we want to `reset` to:
`git log --oneline`

We want to return to the `commit`: `9a9add8 (origin/master) Added .gitignore`, the last one before we started to mess with things.

We `reset` our repository back to the specific commit using `git reset _commithash_` (`_commithash_` being the first 7 characters of the commit hash we found in the `log`):

`git reset 9a9add8`


# Git Amend

## Git commit --amend

`commit --amend` is used to modify the most recent `commit`.

It combines changes in the `staging environment` with the latest `commit`, and creates a new `commit`.

This new `commit` replaces the latest `commit` entirely.

---

## Git Amend Commit Message

One of the simplest things you can do with `--amend` is to change a `commit` message.

Let's update the `README.md` and `commit`:

`git commit -m "Adding plines to reddme"`
`git log --oneline`

Oh no! the `commit` message is full of spelling errors. Embarrassing. Let's `amend` that:
`git commit --amend -m "Added lines to README.md"`

## Git Amend Files

Adding files with `--amend` works the same way as above. Just add them to the `staging environment` before committing.
