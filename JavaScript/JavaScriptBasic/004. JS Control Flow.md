 **Control Flow** statements determine the order in which your JavaScript code is executed. Instead of just running line by line from top to bottom, these structures allow your program to make decisions and repeat actions based on certain conditions.

**1. Conditional Statements: Making Decisions**

These statements allow your code to execute different blocks based on whether a condition is true or false.

*   **`if` Statement**
    *   **Purpose:** Executes a block of code *only if* a specified condition evaluates to `true` (or is "truthy").
    *   **Syntax:**
        ```javascript
        if (condition) {
          // Code to execute if condition is true
        }
        ```
    *   **Example:**
        ```javascript
        let temperature = 25;

        if (temperature > 20) {
          console.log("It's a warm day!"); // This will run
        }

        if (temperature < 0) {
          console.log("It's freezing!"); // This will NOT run
        }
        ```

*   **`else` Statement**
    *   **Purpose:** Executes a block of code if the preceding `if` statement's condition evaluates to `false` (or is "falsy"). It provides an alternative path.
    *   **Syntax:**
        ```javascript
        if (condition) {
          // Code to execute if condition is true
        } else {
          // Code to execute if condition is false
        }
        ```
    *   **Example:**
        ```javascript
        let age = 16;

        if (age >= 18) {
          console.log("Access Granted.");
        } else {
          console.log("Access Denied."); // This will run
        }
        ```

*   **`else if` Statement**
    *   **Purpose:** Allows you to check multiple conditions in sequence. If the first `if` is false, it checks the `else if` condition. If that's also false, it can check subsequent `else if` conditions, finally falling back to an optional `else` block if none of the preceding conditions were true.
    *   **Syntax:**
        ```javascript
        if (condition1) {
          // Code if condition1 is true
        } else if (condition2) {
          // Code if condition1 is false AND condition2 is true
        } else if (condition3) {
          // Code if condition1 and condition2 are false AND condition3 is true
        } else {
          // Code if none of the above conditions are true
        }
        ```
    *   **Example:**
        ```javascript
        let score = 75;

        if (score >= 90) {
          console.log("Grade: A");
        } else if (score >= 80) {
          console.log("Grade: B");
        } else if (score >= 70) {
          console.log("Grade: C"); // This will run
        } else if (score >= 60) {
          console.log("Grade: D");
        } else {
          console.log("Grade: F");
        }
        ```

*   **`switch` Statement**
    *   **Purpose:** An alternative way to handle conditional logic, particularly useful when you need to compare a single expression against multiple possible *constant* values (cases). Often cleaner than a long chain of `if...else if` statements for this specific scenario.
    *   **Syntax:**
        ```javascript
        switch (expression) {
          case value1:
            // Code to execute if expression === value1
            break; // IMPORTANT: Exits the switch statement
          case value2:
            // Code to execute if expression === value2
            break;
          // ... more cases
          default: // Optional
            // Code to execute if expression doesn't match any case
        }
        ```
    *   **Key Points:**
        *   Uses strict comparison (`===`).
        *   The `break` statement is crucial. If omitted, execution will "fall through" to the next `case` block, regardless of whether its value matches. This is sometimes intentional but often a source of bugs if forgotten.
        *   The `default` case acts like the final `else`.
    *   **Example:**
        ```javascript
        let day = new Date().getDay(); // Returns 0 (Sunday) to 6 (Saturday)
        let dayName;

        switch (day) {
          case 0:
            dayName = "Sunday";
            break;
          case 1:
            dayName = "Monday";
            break;
          case 2:
            dayName = "Tuesday";
            break;
          case 3:
            dayName = "Wednesday";
            break;
          case 4:
            dayName = "Thursday";
            break;
          case 5:
            dayName = "Friday";
            break;
          case 6:
            dayName = "Saturday";
            break;
          default: // Should ideally not happen with getDay()
            dayName = "Unknown Day";
        }
        console.log("Today is", dayName);
        ```

**2. Loops: Repeating Actions**

Loops allow you to execute a block of code repeatedly until a certain condition is met.

*   **`for` Loop**
    *   **Purpose:** The most common loop structure. Ideal when you know how many times you want to iterate (e.g., iterating through an array or counting).
    *   **Syntax:**
        ```javascript
        for (initialization; condition; final-expression) {
          // Code to repeat
        }
        ```
        *   `initialization`: Executed once before the loop starts (e.g., `let i = 0`).
        *   `condition`: Evaluated *before* each iteration. If `true`, the loop body runs. If `false`, the loop terminates. (e.g., `i < 5`).
        *   `final-expression`: Executed *after* each iteration (e.g., `i++`).
    *   **Example:**
        ```javascript
        // Count from 0 to 4
        console.log("Counting up:");
        for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
          console.log(i); // Outputs 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
        }

        // Iterate through an array
        let colors = ["red", "green", "blue"];
        console.log("\nColors:");
        for (let i = 0; i < colors.length; i++) {
          console.log(colors[i]); // Outputs red, green, blue
        }
        ```

*   **`while` Loop**
    *   **Purpose:** Executes a block of code *as long as* a specified condition is `true`. Used when the number of iterations is not known beforehand, but depends on a condition changing within the loop.
    *   **Syntax:**
        ```javascript
        while (condition) {
          // Code to repeat
          // IMPORTANT: Something inside the loop must eventually make the condition false!
        }
        ```
    *   **Example:**
        ```javascript
        let countdown = 3;
        console.log("\nWhile Countdown:");
        while (countdown > 0) {
          console.log(countdown);
          countdown--; // Make sure the condition eventually becomes false
        }
        console.log("Blast off!");
        // If countdown-- was forgotten, this would be an infinite loop!
        ```

*   **`do...while` Loop**
    *   **Purpose:** Similar to `while`, but the condition is checked *after* the loop body executes. This guarantees the code block runs *at least once*, even if the condition is initially `false`.
    *   **Syntax:**
        ```javascript
        do {
          // Code to repeat (runs at least once)
        } while (condition); // Note the semicolon here!
        ```
    *   **Example:**
        ```javascript
        let input;
        // Imagine prompt() is a function that gets user input
        // This loop will always run at least once to ask for input
        // do {
        //   input = prompt("Enter 'quit' to exit:");
        //   console.log("You entered:", input);
        // } while (input !== "quit");

        // Example that runs only once because condition is initially false
        let k = 5;
        console.log("\nDo...while example:");
        do {
            console.log("k =", k); // This line runs once
            k++;
        } while (k < 5); // Condition (5 < 5) is false, loop stops
        ```

**3. Loop Control Statements: Modifying Loop Behavior**

These statements change the normal execution flow *within* loops.

*   **`break` Statement**
    *   **Purpose:** Immediately terminates the innermost loop (`for`, `while`, `do...while`) or `switch` statement it's currently inside. Execution continues with the first statement *after* the terminated loop/switch.
    *   **Example:**
        ```javascript
        let numbers = [1, 5, -3, 9, 2];
        let foundNegative = false;
        console.log("\nSearching for negative number:");
        for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
          console.log("Checking:", numbers[i]);
          if (numbers[i] < 0) {
            foundNegative = true;
            console.log("Found a negative number! Stopping search.");
            break; // Exit the loop immediately
          }
        }
        if (!foundNegative) {
            console.log("No negative numbers found.");
        }
        ```

*   **`continue` Statement**
    *   **Purpose:** Skips the *rest* of the current iteration of the loop and proceeds directly to the *next* iteration (checking the condition and running the final-expression in a `for` loop).
    *   **Example:**
        ```javascript
        console.log("\nPrinting only even numbers:");
        for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
          if (i % 2 !== 0) { // If the number is odd
            continue; // Skip the console.log for this iteration
          }
          console.log(i); // Only runs for even numbers (0, 2, 4, 6, 8)
        }
        ```

Control flow statements are the backbone of program logic, allowing you to create dynamic, responsive, and efficient applications by controlling *when* and *how* different parts of your code are executed.
