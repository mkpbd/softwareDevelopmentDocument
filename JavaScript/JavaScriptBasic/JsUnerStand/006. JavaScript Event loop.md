### What is the Event Loop?

The Event Loop is a continuous process that manages the execution of code, handling asynchronous operations by coordinating the **Call Stack**, **Task Queue** (or Event Queue), and **Microtask Queue**. It ensures that JavaScript can process tasks in an orderly manner without blocking the main thread.

### Key Components

1. **Call Stack**:
    - A LIFO (Last In, First Out) structure where JavaScript tracks function execution.
    - When a function is called, it's pushed onto the stack; when it finishes, it's popped off.
    - Example: console.log("Hello") pushes the console.log call onto the stack and removes it after execution.
2. **Task Queue** (Callback Queue):
    - A FIFO (First In, First Out) queue that holds callbacks from asynchronous operations, like setTimeout, DOM events (e.g., clicks), or HTTP requests.
    - Tasks are processed only when the Call Stack is empty.
    - Example: setTimeout(() => console.log("Delayed"), 1000) places the callback in the Task Queue after 1 second.
3. **Microtask Queue**:
    - A higher-priority queue for microtasks, such as Promise resolutions or queueMicrotask callbacks.
    - Microtasks are executed immediately after the current synchronous code finishes, **before** tasks in the Task Queue.
    - Example: Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log("Promise")) adds the callback to the Microtask Queue.
4. **Event Loop**:
    - Continuously checks if the Call Stack is empty.
    - If empty, it processes:
        1. All microtasks in the Microtask Queue (in order) until it's empty.
        2. The next task from the Task Queue (one per loop iteration).
    - This ensures non-blocking behavior and proper task prioritization.
5. **Web APIs** (Browser/Node.js):
    - Provided by the runtime environment (not part of JavaScript itself), Web APIs handle asynchronous operations like setTimeout, fetch, or DOM events.
    - When an async operation completes, its callback is pushed to the Task Queue or Microtask Queue.

### How It Works

1. JavaScript executes synchronous code, pushing functions onto the Call Stack.
2. When an async operation (e.g., setTimeout or fetch) is encountered, it's offloaded to a Web API.
3. The Web API processes the operation (e.g., waits for a timer or network response) and, upon completion, pushes the callback to the appropriate queue:
    - setTimeout → Task Queue.
    - Promise → Microtask Queue.
4. The Event Loop monitors the Call Stack:
    - If the stack is empty, it processes all microtasks in the Microtask Queue.
    - Then, it moves one task from the Task Queue to the Call Stack for execution.
5. This cycle repeats, ensuring asynchronous tasks are handled efficiently.

### Example

```js
console.log("Start");

setTimeout(() => console.log("Timeout"), 0);

Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log("Promise"));

console.log("End");
```

**Explanation**:

1. "Start" is logged (synchronous, Call Stack).
2. setTimeout is registered with Web API, callback added to Task Queue after 0ms.
3. Promise.resolve().then adds callback to Microtask Queue.
4. "End" is logged (synchronous).
5. Call Stack is empty, so Event Loop:
    - Processes Microtask Queue → "Promise" is logged.
    - Processes Task Queue → "Timeout" is logged.

### Key Points

- **Single-threaded**: JavaScript runs on one thread, but the Event Loop makes it seem concurrent by offloading tasks to Web APIs.
- **Microtasks vs. Tasks**: Microtasks (e.g., Promises) have higher priority than tasks (e.g., setTimeout), so they're executed first.
- **Non-blocking**: Async operations don't block the main thread, allowing the UI to remain responsive in browsers.
- **Starvation Risk**: If the Microtask Queue keeps getting new tasks (e.g., recursive Promises), Task Queue tasks (like setTimeout) may be delayed.

### Practical Implications

- **UI Responsiveness**: In browsers, the Event Loop ensures that rendering and user interactions (e.g., clicks) are prioritized over heavy computations.
- **Promise Handling**: Use Promises for predictable async behavior, as they execute before timers.
- **Performance**: Avoid long-running synchronous code or excessive microtasks, as they can delay rendering or other tasks.

### Node.js vs. Browser

- **Node.js**: Uses a similar Event Loop but with additional queues (e.g., for I/O operations) and the libuv library instead of Web APIs.
- **Browser**: Integrates with DOM events and rendering, which are prioritized in the Event Loop.

Example 1: Basic Synchronous and Asynchronous Mix

```js
console.log("Start");

setTimeout(() => console.log("Timeout"), 0);

console.log("End");
```

1. **Call Stack**:
    - console.log("Start") is synchronous, pushed onto the Call Stack, executed, and popped off, printing "Start".
    - setTimeout(() => console.log("Timeout"), 0) is encountered. The timer is offloaded to the **Web API**, which waits for 0ms (effectively the minimum delay). The callback () => console.log("Timeout") is not immediately executed.
    - console.log("End") is synchronous, executed next, printing "End".
2. **Web API**: After the 0ms timer expires, the Web API pushes the setTimeout callback to the **Task Queue**.
3. **Event Loop**:
    - The Call Stack is now empty (after "End" is logged).
    - The Event Loop checks the **Microtask Queue** (empty in this case).
    - It then moves the callback from the **Task Queue** to the Call Stack.
4. **Call Stack**: The callback executes, printing "Timeout".
5. **Key Insight**: Even with a 0ms delay, setTimeout is asynchronous and waits for synchronous code to finish, demonstrating the Event Loop's role in deferring tasks.

### Example 2: Promises and Microtasks

```js
console.log("Start");

setTimeout(() => console.log("Timeout"), 0);

Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log("Promise"));

console.log("End");
```

**Explanation**:

1. **Call Stack**:
    - console.log("Start") executes, printing "Start".
    - setTimeout(() => console.log("Timeout"), 0) is offloaded to the **Web API**, with its callback destined for the **Task Queue** after 0ms.
    - Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log("Promise")) creates a resolved Promise, and its .then callback is immediately pushed to the **Microtask Queue**.
    - console.log("End") executes, printing "End".
2. **Web API**: The setTimeout timer expires, pushing its callback to the **Task Queue**.
3. **Event Loop**:
    - The Call Stack is empty after synchronous code finishes.
    - The Event Loop prioritizes the **Microtask Queue**, executing the Promise callback, which prints "Promise".
    - Only after the Microtask Queue is empty does the Event Loop move the setTimeout callback from the **Task Queue** to the Call Stack.
4. **Call Stack**: The setTimeout callback executes, printing "Timeout".
5. **Key Insight**: Microtasks (Promises) have higher priority than tasks (setTimeout), so they execute before Task Queue items, even if the timer delay is 0ms.

### Example 3: Multiple Promises and Microtask Chaining

```js
console.log("Start");

setTimeout(() => console.log("Timeout"), 0);

Promise.resolve()
  .then(() => console.log("Promise 1"))
  .then(() => console.log("Promise 2"));

console.log("End");
```

**Explanation**:

1. **Call Stack**:
    - console.log("Start") prints "Start".
    - setTimeout(() => console.log("Timeout"), 0) is sent to the **Web API**, with its callback queued in the **Task Queue** after 0ms.
    - Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log("Promise 1")).then(() => console.log("Promise 2")) creates a Promise chain. The first .then callback is pushed to the **Microtask Queue**. The second .then callback is not queued yet (it depends on the first .then resolving).
    - console.log("End") prints "End".
2. **Web API**: The setTimeout callback is pushed to the **Task Queue** after 0ms.
3. **Event Loop**:
    - The Call Stack is empty.
    - The Event Loop processes the **Microtask Queue**:
        - The first Promise callback executes, printing "Promise 1". This resolves the first .then, queuing the second .then callback in the **Microtask Queue**.
        - The Event Loop processes the next microtask, executing the second callback, printing "Promise 2".
    - The **Microtask Queue** is now empty, so the Event Loop moves the setTimeout callback from the **Task Queue** to the Call Stack.
4. **Call Stack**: The setTimeout callback prints "Timeout".
5. **Key Insight**: Chained Promises create sequential microtasks, all of which are processed before any Task Queue tasks, highlighting the Event Loop's prioritization.

### Example 4: Mixing Timers, Promises, and Loops

```js
console.log("Start");

setTimeout(() => console.log("Timeout 1"), 0);
setTimeout(() => console.log("Timeout 2"), 0);

Promise.resolve().then(() => {
  console.log("Promise");
  for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    console.log(`Loop ${i}`);
  }
});

console.log("End");
```

**Explanation**:

1. **Call Stack**:
    - console.log("Start") prints "Start".
    - The first setTimeout(() => console.log("Timeout 1"), 0) is sent to the **Web API**, with its callback queued in the **Task Queue**.
    - The second setTimeout(() => console.log("Timeout 2"), 0) is also sent to the **Web API**, queued after the first.
    - Promise.resolve().then(...) pushes its callback (containing console.log("Promise") and the loop) to the **Microtask Queue**.
    - console.log("End") prints "End".
2. **Web API**: Both setTimeout callbacks are pushed to the **Task Queue** in order (Timeout 1, then Timeout 2).
3. **Event Loop**:
    - The Call Stack is empty.
    - The **Microtask Queue** is processed:
        - The Promise callback executes, printing "Promise".
        - The for loop runs synchronously within the callback, printing "Loop 0", "Loop 1", and "Loop 2".
    - The **Microtask Queue** is now empty, so the Event Loop processes the **Task Queue**:
        - The first setTimeout callback executes, printing "Timeout 1".
        - The second setTimeout callback executes, printing "Timeout 2".
4. **Key Insight**: The entire Promise callback, including the loop, is treated as a single microtask. The Event Loop ensures all microtasks complete before moving to the Task Queue.

Example 5: Microtask Starvation

```js
console.log("Start");

setTimeout(() => console.log("Timeout"), 0);

Promise.resolve().then(function resolve() {
  console.log("Promise");
  Promise.resolve().then(resolve);
});

console.log("End");
```

**Explanation**:

1. **Call Stack**:
    - console.log("Start") prints "Start".
    - setTimeout(() => console.log("Timeout"), 0) is sent to the **Web API**, with its callback queued in the **Task Queue**.
    - Promise.resolve().then(function resolve() {...}) pushes the resolve function to the **Microtask Queue**.
    - console.log("End") prints "End".
2. **Web API**: The setTimeout callback is pushed to the **Task Queue**.
3. **Event Loop**:
    - The Call Stack is empty.
    - The **Microtask Queue** is processed:
        - The resolve function executes, printing "Promise".
        - Inside resolve, Promise.resolve().then(resolve) creates a new Promise and queues another call to resolve in the **Microtask Queue**.
        - This creates a recursive loop, continually adding new microtasks.
    - The Event Loop keeps processing the **Microtask Queue**, never reaching the **Task Queue** because new microtasks are constantly added.
4. **Call Stack**: The setTimeout callback ("Timeout") is never executed because the **Microtask Queue** is never emptied.
5. **Key Insight**: This demonstrates **microtask starvation**, where excessive microtasks (e.g., recursive Promises) prevent Task Queue tasks from running. In real-world applications, this can delay rendering or other async operations.

---

### General Insights

- **Synchronous Priority**: Synchronous code (e.g., console.log) always runs first, filling the Call Stack.
- **Microtask Priority**: Microtasks (Promises, queueMicrotask) are processed before tasks (setTimeout, DOM events), ensuring Promises execute as soon as possible.
- **Task Queue**: Handles traditional async callbacks, processed one at a time per Event Loop iteration.
- **Starvation Risk**: Overloading the Microtask Queue can delay or prevent Task Queue execution, impacting performance.
- **Web APIs**: Enable async behavior by offloading tasks (timers, network requests) outside the- JavaScript engine.

### Practical Takeaways

- Use Promises for predictable async operations, but avoid recursive microtask chains to prevent starvation.
- Be mindful of setTimeout delays; even with 0ms, they defer to the Task Queue, after microtasks.
- In browsers, the Event Loop also coordinates with rendering, so heavy microtasks can delay UI updates.
