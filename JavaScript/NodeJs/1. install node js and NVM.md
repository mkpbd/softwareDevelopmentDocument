# Node Version Manager

## What is NVM?

Node Version Manager (NVM), as the name implies, is a tool for managing Node versions on your device.

Different projects on your device may be using different versions of Node. Using only one version (the one installed by `npm`) for these different projects may not give you accurate execution results.

For example, if you use a Node version of **10.0.0** for a project that uses **12.0.0**, you may get some errors. And if you update the Node version to **12.0.0** with npm, and you use it for a project that uses **10.0.0**, you may not get the expected experience.

[NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) allows you to install different versions of Node, and switch between these versions depending on the project that you're working on via the command line.

## How to Install NVM on Windows

NVM is mostly supported on Linux and Mac. It doesn't have support for Windows. But there's a similar tool created by coreybutler to provide an nvm experience in Windows called [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows).

`nvm-windows` provides a management utility for managing Node.js versions in Windows. Here's how to install it:

### 2. Install the .exe file of the latest release

In the latest release (which as of the time of writing this is [1.1.9](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases/tag/1.1.9)), you'll find different assets. Click on the **nvm-setup.exe** asset which is the installation file for the tool:

### 3. Complete the Installation Wizard

Open the file that you have downloaded, and complete the installation wizard.
````bash
nvm -v
````


## Wrapping up

With nvm installed, you can now install, uninstall, and switch between different Node versions in your Windows, Linux, or Mac device.

You can install Node versions like this:

```bash
nvm install latest
```
This command will install the last version of Node:
```bash
nvm install vX.Y.Z
```

You can also make a version your default by running:
```bash
nvm alias default vX.Y.Z
```

 1. `nvm install lts` - installs the latest LTS patch version (new). ([@tats-u](https://github.com/tats-u))
2. `nvm use latest`, `nvm use lts` ([@tats-u](https://github.com/tats-u)), and `nvm use newest` (new) ([@EEJesse](https://github.com/EEJesse)) now supported.
3. Elevated permissions applied only when necessary [#511](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/pull/511) ([@rbuckton](https://github.com/rbuckton)).
4. `nvm current` (new) displays the active version. ([@riazXrazor](https://github.com/riazXrazor))

## NPM

NPM stands for **Node Package Manager**. It is a Javascript package manager and the default package manager for Node projects. NPM is installed when NodeJS is installed on a machine. It comes with a command-line interface (CLI) used to interact with the online database of NPM. , and it hosts public and private 'packages.' To add or update packages, we use the NPM CLI to interact with this database. 

Isaac Z. Schlueter developed NPM purely in Javascript. It was first released in November 2010. Ever since, NPM has had a lot of updates and has improved in terms of efficiency, speed and security.
`npm -v`

## What is NPX?

NPX stands for **Node Package eXecute**. It is simply an NPM package runner. It allows developers to execute any Javascript Package available on the NPM registry without even installing it. NPX is installed automatically with NPM version 5.2.0 and above.

To check whether or not NPX is installed on your machine, you can run the following command on the terminal:
`npx -v`
