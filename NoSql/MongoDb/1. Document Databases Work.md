A document database has information retrieved or stored in the form of a document or other words semi-structured database. Since they are non-relational, so they are often referred to as NoSQL data. 

The document database fetches and accumulates data in forms of key-value pairs but here, the values are called as Documents. A document can be stated as a complex data structure. Document here can be a form of text, arrays, strings, JSON, XML, or any such format. The use of nested documents is also very common. It is very effective as most of the data created is usually in the form of JSON and is unstructured.

# MongoDB: Getting Started
**Terminologies**:   
A MongoDB **Database** can be called as the container for all the collections. 

- **Collection** is a bunch of MongoDB documents. It is similar to tables in RDBMS.
- **Document** is made of fields. It is similar to a tuple in RDBMS, but it has dynamic schema here. Documents of the same collection need not have the same set of fields

**Getting Started**

mongo: The Command Line Interface to interact with the db.
mongod: This is the database. Sets up the server.
mongodump: It dumps out the Binary of the Database(BSON)
mongoexport: Exports the document to Json, CSV format
mongoimport: To import some data into the DB.
mongorestore: to restore anything that you’ve exported.
mongostat: Statistics of databases

# What is MongoDB – Working and Features

![[Pasted image 20240512155156.jpg]]



## Database

Database is a physical container for collections. Each database gets its own set of files on the file system. A single MongoDB server typically has multiple databases.

## Collection

Collection is a group of MongoDB documents. It is the equivalent of an RDBMS table. A collection exists within a single database. Collections do not enforce a schema. Documents within a collection can have different fields. Typically, all documents in a collection are of similar or related purpose.

## Document

A document is a set of key-value pairs. Documents have dynamic schema. Dynamic schema means that documents in the same collection do not need to have the same set of fields or structure, and common fields in a collection's documents may hold different types of data.

The following table shows the relationship of RDBMS terminology with MongoDB.

| RDBMS                      | MongoDB                                                  |

[BSON Types - MongoDB Manual v7.0](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/bson-types/)


## Working with Database Commands

#### Create Database

`use <database name>`
To create a database named mydb, use this command:
`use mydb`

#### Drop Database

`db.dropDatabase()`
Note If no database is selected, the default database test is dropped.

#### Display List of Databases
```shell
show dbs
show databases
```
Note The newly created database mydb is not shown in the list.
This is because the database needs to have at least one collection to
display in the list. The default database is test.

#### Display the Version of MongoDB
`db.version()`
### Display a List of Commands
`db.help()`


## MongoDB CRUD Operations

#### Create a Collection
`db.createCollection (<name>)`

```shell
db.createCollection("person")
```

#### Display Collection 
```shell
show collections
```

#### Insert Documents

| db.collection.insertOne  | Inserts a single document                       |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| db.collection.insertMany | Inserts multiple documents                      |
| db.collection.insert     | Inserts a single document or multiple documents |
#### Step 1: Insert a Single Document
```shell
db.person.insertOne({_id:1001,name:"Taanushree AS",age:10})
```

insertOne() returns a document that contains the newly inserted document’s _id.
If you don’t specify an _id field, MongoDB generates an _id field with
an ObjectId value. The _id field act as the primary key.

#### Step 2: Insert Multiple Documents
```shell
db.person.insertMany([{_id:1003,name:"Anba V M",age:16},{_id:10
04,name:"shobana",age:44}])
```

#### Read Operations
Read operations allow us to retrieve documents from a collection.
MongoDB provides the find() method to query documents.
The syntax for the find() command is

`db.collection.find()`

#### Query Documents
##### Step 1: Select All Documents in a collection
```shell
db.person.find({})
```

##### Step 2: Specify Equality Conditions
To specify an equality condition, you need to use `<field>:<value>`
expressions in the query to filter documents.

```shell
db.person.find({name:"shobana"})
```
##### Step 3: Specify Conditions Using Query Operator
To select all documents from the collection person where age is greater
than 10, here is the command:
```sehll
db.person.find({age:{$gt:10}})
```

##### Step 4: Specify AND Conditions
In a compound query, you can specify conditions for more than one field.
To select all documents in the person collection where the name equals
```shell
db.person.find({ name:"shobana",age:{$gt:10}})
```
##### Step 5: Specify OR Conditions
You can use $or in a compound query to join each clause with a logical or conjunction.
The operator $or selects the documents from the collection that match
at least one of the selected conditions.
To select all documents in the person collection where the name equals "shobana" or age equals 20, here is the command:

```shell
db.person.find( { $or: [ { name: "shobana" }, { age: { $eq: 20
} } ] } )
```

### Update Operations
Update operations allow us to modify existing documents in a collection.
MongoDB provides the update methods listed


| db.collection.updateOne<br><br> | To modify a single document                                                         |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| db.collection.updateMany        | To modify multiple documents                                                        |
| db.collection.replaceOne        | To replace the first matching document in the<br>collection that matches the filter |
|                                 |                                                                                     |
```shell
db.collection.updateOne()
db.collection.updateMany()
db.collection.replaceOne()
```

##### Step 1: Update a Single Document
MongoDB provides modify operators to modify field values such as `$set`.
To use the update operators, pass to the update methods an update

```js
{
<update operator>: { <field1>: <value1>, ... },
<update operator>: { <field2>: <value2>, ... },
...
}
```

```js
db.student.updateOne({name: "Joshi"},{$set:{"marks.english": 20}})
```

Note You cannot update the _id field.


##### Step 2: Update Multiple Documents
```js
db.student.updateMany( { "result":"fail" }, { $set: { "marks.
english": 20, marks.maths: 20 } })
```

##### Step 3: Replace a Document
You can replace the entire content of a document except the _id field
by passing an entirely new document as the second argument to db.
collection.replaceOne() as shown here.
Execute the following command to replace the first document from the
student collection where name equals "John".

```json
db.student.replaceOne( { name: "John" }, {_id:1001,name:"John",
marks:{english:36,maths:39},result:"pass"})
```

Note Do not include update operators in the replacement
document. You can omit the _id field in the replacement document
because the _id field is immutable. However, if you want to include
the _id field, use the same value as the current value.


#### Delete Operations
Delete operations allow us to delete documents from a collection.


| db.collection.deleteOne <br> | To delete a single document  |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| db.collection.updateMany     | To delete multiple documents |

```json
db.collection.deleteOne()
db.collection.deleteMany()
```

##### Step 1: Delete Only One Document That Matchesa Condition

```json
db.student.deleteOne({name: "John"})
```
##### Step 2: Delete All Documents That Match a Condition
```json
db.student.deleteMany({name: "Jack"})
```


## Embedded Documents in MongoDB
Using embedded documents allows us to embed a document within
another document. Consider this example.

```json
db.employee.insertMany([
   {
      "_id":1001,
      "name":"John",
      "address":{
         "previous":"123,1st Main",
         "current":"234,2nd Main"
      },
      "unit":"Hadoop"
   },
   {
      "_id":1002,
      "name":"Jack",
      "address":{
         "previous":"Cresent Street",
         "current":"234,Bald Hill Street"
      },
      "unit":"MongoDB"
   },
   {
      "_id":1003,
      "name":"James",
      "address":{
         "previous":"Cresent Street",
         "current":"234,Hill Street"
      },
      "unit":"Spark"
   }
])
```

#### Step 1: Match an Embedded or Nested Document
To perform an equality match on the embedded document, you need to
specify the exact match document in the `<value>` document, including the
field order.
To select all documents where the address field equals the document

```json
db.employee.find({
   "address":{
      "previous":"Cresent Street",
      "current":"234,Bald Hill Street"
   }
})
```



#### Step 2: Query on a Nested Field
We can use dot notation to query a field of the embedded document.
To select all documents where the previous field nested in the address
field equals "Cresent Street",
`db.employee.find( { "address.previous": "Cresent Street" } )`

```json
db.employee.find( { "address.previous": "Cresent Street" } )
```

## Working with Arrays

#### Step 1: Match an Array
```json
db.employeedetails.insertMany([
   {
      "name":"John",
      "projects":[
         "MongoDB",
         "Hadoop",
         "Spark"
      ],
      "scores":[
         25,
         28,
         29
      ]
   },
   {
      "name":"James",
      "projects":[
         "Cassandra",
         "Spark"
      ],
      "scores":[
         26,
         24,
         23
      ]
   },
   {
      "name":"Smith",
      "projects":[
         "Hadoop",
         "MongoDB"
      ],
      "scores":[
         22,
         28,
         26
      ]
   }
])
```

### Step 2: Query an Array for an Element
To query all documents where projects is an array that contains the string
"MongoDB" as one of its elements, execute the following command.
```json
db.employeedetails.find( { projects: "MongoDB" } )

```
### Step 3: Specify Query Operators
To query all documents where the scores field is an array that contains at
least one element whose value is greater than 26 we can use the $gt operator.
```json
db.employeedetails.find( { scores:{$gt:26} } )
```
### Step 4: Query an Array with Compound Filter
Conditions on the Array Elements
```json
db.employeedetails.find( { scores: { $gt: 20, $lt: 24 } } )
```
### Step 5: Using the $elemMatch operator
The $elemMatch operator allows us to specify multiple conditions on the
array elements such that at least one array element should satisfy all of the
specified conditions.
```json
db.employeedetails.find( { scores: { $elemMatch: { $gt: 23,
$lt: 27 } } } )
```

### Step 6: Query an Array Element by Index Position
Use dot notation to query an array element by its index position.
Use this code to select all documents where the third element in the scores array is greater than 26.

```json
db.employeedetails.find( { "scores.2": { $gt: 26 } } )

```

### Step 7: Using the $size Operator
You can use the $size operator to query an array by number of elements.
To select all documents where the projects array has two elements, use this code.

```json
db.employeedetails.find( { "projects": { $size: 2 } } )
```

### Step 8: Using the $push Operator

You can use the $push operator to add a value to an array. To add work location details, use this code.

```json
db.employeedetails.update({name:"James"},{$push:{Location: "US"}})
```

### Step 9: Using the $addToSet Operator

You can use the $addToSet operator to add a value to an array. $addToSet
adds a value to an array only if a value is not present. If a value is present, it
does not do anything. To add hobbies to the employeedetails collection, use this code.

```json
db.employeedetails.update( {name: "James"}, { $addToSet:
{hobbies: [ "drawing", "dancing"]} })
```

### Step 10: Using the $pop Operator
You can use the $pop operator to remove the first or last element of an array.
To remove the first element in the scores array, use this code.

```json
db.employeedetails.update( {name: "James"},{ $pop:
{scores:-1}})
```

## Query an Array of Embedded Documents

#### Step 1: Query for a Document Nested in an Array
```json
db.studentmarks.insertMany([
   {
      "name":"John",
      "marks":[
         {
            "class":"II",
            "total":489
         },
         {
            "class":"III",
            "total":490
         }
      ]
   },
   {
      "name":"James",
      "marks":[
         {
            "class":"III",
            "total":469
         },
         {
            "class":"IV",
            "total":450
         }
      ]
   },
   {
      "name":"Jack",
      "marks":[
         {
            "class":"II",
            "total":489
         },
         {
            "class":"III",
            "total":390
         }
      ]
   },
   {
      "name":"Smith",
      "marks":[
         {
            "class":"III",
            "total":489
         },
         {
            "class":"IV",
            "total":490
         }
      ]
   },
   {
      "name":"Joshi",
      "marks":[
         {
            "class":"II",
            "total":465
         },
         {
            "class":"III",
            "total":470
         }
      ]
   }
])
```

##### Note Equality matching on the array of an embedded document requires an exact match of the specified document, including field order.

### Step 2: Query for a Field Embedded in an Array of Documents
You can use dot notation to query a field embedded in an array of documents. The following command selects all documents in the marks array where at least one embedded document contains the field total that.
```json
db.studentmarks.find( { 'marks.total': { $lt: 400 } } )
```
