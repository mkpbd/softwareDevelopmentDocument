A document database has information retrieved or stored in the form of a document or other words semi-structured database. Since they are non-relational, so they are often referred to as NoSQL data. 

The document database fetches and accumulates data in forms of key-value pairs but here, the values are called as Documents. A document can be stated as a complex data structure. Document here can be a form of text, arrays, strings, JSON, XML, or any such format. The use of nested documents is also very common. It is very effective as most of the data created is usually in the form of JSON and is unstructured.

# MongoDB: Getting Started
**Terminologies**:   
A MongoDB **Database** can be called as the container for all the collections. 

- **Collection** is a bunch of MongoDB documents. It is similar to tables in RDBMS.
- **Document** is made of fields. It is similar to a tuple in RDBMS, but it has dynamic schema here. Documents of the same collection need not have the same set of fields

**Getting Started**

mongo: The Command Line Interface to interact with the db.
mongod: This is the database. Sets up the server.
mongodump: It dumps out the Binary of the Database(BSON)
mongoexport: Exports the document to Json, CSV format
mongoimport: To import some data into the DB.
mongorestore: to restore anything that you’ve exported.
mongostat: Statistics of databases

## Database

Database is a physical container for collections. Each database gets its own set of files on the file system. A single MongoDB server typically has multiple databases.

## Collection

Collection is a group of MongoDB documents. It is the equivalent of an RDBMS table. A collection exists within a single database. Collections do not enforce a schema. Documents within a collection can have different fields. Typically, all documents in a collection are of similar or related purpose.

## Document

A document is a set of key-value pairs. Documents have dynamic schema. Dynamic schema means that documents in the same collection do not need to have the same set of fields or structure, and common fields in a collection's documents may hold different types of data.

The following table shows the relationship of RDBMS terminology with MongoDB.
