# Advanced Hospital Management System (HMS) Specification

## System Overview

Design a **scalable, secure, and modular monolithic** Hospital Management System (HMS) using **.NET 9**, **PostgreSQL 16+**, and **ASP.NET Core Identity**. The system must support **multi-tenancy** (for hospital chains), **offline-capable modules** for critical operations, and comply with **HIPAA** and **GDPR** standards. Implement **Clean Architecture**, **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**, and **Vertical Slice Architecture** for maintainability, with robust **background job processing** and **real-time communication**.
