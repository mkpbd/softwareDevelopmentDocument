There are several prompt types that could be useful. For example, you could use:
## **Code generation prompts:** Ask the model to generate code snippets for specific tasks, like creating a controller endpoint or data model. 
## **Code explanation prompts:** Provide a piece of code and ask the model to explain what it does or identify potential issues.
## **Code translation prompts:** Convert code from one language or framework to another.


## For code generation prompts

For code generation prompts with .NET Web API, you'll want to be as specific as possible. For example, instead of saying "create an API endpoint," try something like "Create a .NET Web API endpoint that accepts a POST request with a JSON payload containing 'name' and 'email' fields, validates the email format, and saves the data to a SQL Server database.



## Example 

Create a .NET Web API endpoint named 'AddStudent' that accepts a POST request with a JSON payload containing 'firstName', 'lastName', and 'email' fields. Validate that the 'firstName' and 'lastName' fields are not empty and that the 'email' field is a valid email address. If the validation passes, create a new 'Student' object and save it to a SQL Server database using Entity Framework Core. Return a 201 Created response with the ID of the newly created student.

## Example 2
"Teacher" endpoint: "Create a .NET Web API endpoint named 'CreateTeacher' that accepts a POST request with a JSON payload containing 'firstName', 'lastName', 'email', and 'subject' fields. Validate that the 'firstName', 'lastName', and 'subject' fields are not empty, and that the 'email' field is a valid email address. If the validation passes, create a new 'Teacher' object and save it to a SQL Server database using Entity Framework Core. Return a 201 Created response with the ID of the newly created teacher.


## Example 3  Full Crud

 you want an example of a full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) implementation for a "Subject" entity using .NET Web API. 
 Here's a prompt that covers all four operations: 
 "Create a .NET Web API controller named 'SubjectsController' with full CRUD operations for a 'Subject' entity. 
 Include the following endpoints: * 'CreateSubject': Accepts a POST request with a JSON payload containing 'name' and 'description' fields. 
 Validates that the 'name' field is not empty. Creates a new 'Subject' object and saves it to a SQL Server database using Entity Framework Core.
  Returns a 201 Created response with the ID of the newly created subject. * 'GetSubjectById': Accepts a GET request with an 'id' parameter. Retrieves the subject with the specified ID from the database. 
  Returns a 200 OK response with the subject data, or a 404 Not Found response if the subject does not exist. * 'UpdateSubject': Accepts a PUT request with an 'id' parameter and a JSON payload containing 'name' and 'description' fields. 
  Validates that the 'name' field is not empty. 
  Updates the subject with the specified ID in the database. Returns a 204 No Content response if the update was successful, or a 404 Not Found response if the subject does not exist. * 'DeleteSubject': Accepts a DELETE request with an 'id' parameter.
   Deletes the subject with the specified ID from the database. Returns a 204 No Content response if the deletion was successful, or a 404 Not Found response if the subject does not exist.


## Example  3 Complex 


"Teacher" entity using the CQRS pattern. This is a more complex request, so the prompt will need to be very detailed.
"Create a .NET Web API application with full CRUD operations for a 'Teacher' entity, implemented using the CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) pattern.
Use Entity Framework Core for data access and MediatR for command and query dispatching. Include the following: 
1. **Teacher Entity:** Define a 'Teacher' entity with properties like 'Id', 'FirstName', 'LastName', 'Email', and 'Subject'. 
2. **Commands:** * 'CreateTeacherCommand': Handles the creation of a new teacher. * 'UpdateTeacherCommand': Handles the updating of an existing teacher. * 'DeleteTeacherCommand': Handles the deletion of a teacher. 
3. **Queries:** * 'GetTeacherByIdQuery': Retrieves a teacher by their ID. * 'GetAllTeachersQuery': Retrieves all teachers. 
4. **Command and Query Handlers:** Implement handlers for each command and query, responsible for executing the corresponding operations. 
5. **Controllers:** Create a 'TeachersController' with endpoints for each CRUD operation, dispatching the appropriate commands and queries using MediatR. 
6. **Data Validation:** Implement data validation for all input models using FluentValidation.
7. **Dependency Injection:** Configure dependency injection for all required services, including the DbContext, MediatR, and validators. 
For each endpoint, ensure proper request handling, data validation, database interaction, and response formatting. Return appropriate HTTP status codes for success and failure scenarios." This is a complex prompt, and the response will likely be quite extensive
