## Role-Based Prompting
Act as a...
You are a ...
Product manager. Help me define features/ help me define
an MVP for an app that does XYZ
Software architect. Advise me on how to scaffold my
project/advise me about what technologies I should use
to build my app
Career Coach. Review my resume/ask me interview
questions/help me figure out what to ask the interviewer



You are now a product owner tasked with gathering requirements for this project. What
features and functionality should this application have? Ask me clarifying questions, if
necessary.



You are the Product Manager of this application. Please advice me, as a software engineer,
which user stories are most necessary to cheate an MVP for prototyping and demo
purposes.


As a Product Manager, my main goal would be to identify the most critical features that
provide the core value of the product for our Minimum Viable Product (MVP). Given the user
stories we have, here are the ones I'd prioritize for the MVP:


Act as a software architect and give me advice on how to design the front end of a React
application based on the following user stories:
As a user, I want to be able to assign a unique nickname to my plant, so that I can easily
identify and personalize each plant I own. This is a basic feature to allow users to manage
multiple plants.
As a user, I want to upload an image of my plant, so I can visualize it within the app. Having
visuql representation is key to the user experience.


You and I are a software engineering team. Discuss the requirements for the first 3 user
stories and turn them into tickets to be entered in Jira.



## Review

- Use phrases like "Act as a..." and "You are a..."

to prompt ChatGPT to assume a certain role

- Prompt ChatGPT to ask clarifying questions

- Assume a role to define technologies,

determine key features, and write user stories

  

## Exercise - https://chat.openai.com/

Scenario: Use role-based prompting to get advice

on how create an MVP (minimum viable product)

for a booking website that displays information on hotel resorts.

  

1. Start with a prompt that yields a

broad overview of what you might need for an MVP.

2. Pick one area to focus on and answer the clarifying questions

3. Use ChatGPT to create 5 user stories for that area of focus.

  

# I want to build a simple booking website for resort hotels. Act as a product manager and help me identify features I should include in an MVP.

  

**Resort Listings:**

- Detailed pages for each resort with:

    - Photos, a brief description, available amenities, and room types with prices.

    - User reviews and ratings.

  

## Let's focus on Resort Listings. Acting as a product manager, decide on the 5 most important features and write user stories for them.

  

### Feature: Detailed Resort Information

User Story:

As a user,

When I click on a resort name or image from the search results,

I want to see a detailed page with an overview, amenities, room types, and other resort-specific information,

So that I can get a comprehensive idea of what the resort offers.

  

### Feature: High-Quality Images & Virtual Tours

User Story:

As a user,

When I'm browsing a resort's listing,

I want to view high-quality images and, if possible, virtual tours of rooms and facilities,

So that I can visually assess the quality and ambiance of the resort.

  

### Feature: User Reviews & Ratings

User Story:

As a user,

When I'm considering a resort,

I want to read reviews and see ratings from other guests,

So that I can make an informed decision based on previous guests' experiences.

  

### Feature: Availability & Pricing Information

User Story:

As a user,

When I'm on a resort listing,

I want to see clear information about room availability, types, and their pricing for my selected dates,

  

So that I can quickly determine if the resort fits my budget and availability needs.

### Feature: Easy Navigation & Call to Action

User Story:

As a user,

When I'm convinced about a resort,

I want clear navigation options like 'Book Now' or 'Contact Resort' and any ongoing special deals highlighted,

So that I can take immediate action without searching around.



# Effective Prompt Engineering:
# Prompting With Examples


Please write a function to total an array of numbers and return the value as a dollar amount:
Example input: [5,40.5, 9,45, 23,50]
Example output: $172.50


Please generate some dummy JSON data for music events. Include the following properties,
plus any other properties that would be typical to this type of data:
- band name
- event date and time
- ticket cost
- venue
- band genre
Please put the data in an order that makes sense. Make dummy data for no more than 2
bands.


Please write a function that will take in this data and return a new object where the
eventDateTime is converted to a human readable format. Example:


# Challenge: Seltzer Flavor Generator

### Seltzer Flavor Generator
Prompt GPT to create a function that generates random
seltzer water flavors like Funky Raspberry Pineapple,
Wacky Strawberry Whipped Cream, Zippy Pineapple Mango
[Adjective Flavor Flavor]. Flavor titles should be
capitalized!
Give GPT example inputs and outputs (function should
accept an array of adjectives and an array of flavors)
Ask GPT to generate the arrays. Your decision if they're
delicious, weird, bizarre
Test the function and iterate if GPT doesn't produce exactly
what you want
