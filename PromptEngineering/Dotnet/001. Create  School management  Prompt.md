Create a School Management System using MCP Server, where the AI agent interacts with a SQL Server database to perform CRUD operations, and a .NET Web API provides endpoints for data access, utilizing Entity Framework Core for entity management and Identity Framework for authentication.

First, design the database schema to store school-related data, including students, teachers, courses, and grades.

The database schema will consist of the following tables: 
Students, Teachers, Courses, Grades, and UserAccounts.

Next, create a .NET
