Create a School Management System using MCP Server, where the AI agent interacts with a SQL Server database to perform CRUD operations, and a .NET Web API provides endpoints for data access, utilizing Entity Framework Core for entity management and Identity Framework for authentication.

First, design the database schema to store school-related data, including students, teachers, courses, and grades.

The database schema will consist of the following tables: 
Students, Teachers, Courses, Grades, and UserAccounts.

Next, create a .NET




## my bed  prompt  School management

you are a ai agent now you want to make a MCP SERVER for School management where your ai go to your sql server insert update select delet query run and dotnet wep api for end point and user ef core for entity and identity framework for authentication now make a mcp server give example step by step how can i improve this prompt


### Improved Prompt (Version 1 - Clear & Professional)

> You are an AI agent tasked with developing an MCP (Multi-Channel Platform) Server for a **School Management System**.
> 
> **Requirements:**
> 
> 1. Use **SQL Server** for data storage and support the following operations via your AI logic:
>     
>     - Insert
>         
>     - Update
>         
>     - Select
>         
>     - Delete
>         
> 2. Build a **.NET Web API** as the backend server.
>     
> 3. Use **Entity Framework Core (EF Core)** for data access and entity mapping.
>     
> 4. Implement **ASP.NET Identity** for authentication and user management.
>     
> 
> âœ… Provide a step-by-step guide (with code examples where needed) to:
> 
> - Set up the project (EF Core + Identity)
>     
> - Design the database schema for a school (Students, Teachers, Classes, Subjects, etc.)
>     
> - Create models and DbContext
>     
> - Create API endpoints (CRUD for Students, Teachers, etc.)
>     
> - Secure the API using Identity
>     
> - Perform sample queries via your AI logic (e.g., select students in a class)
>     
> 
> ðŸŽ¯ Goal: Simulate an MCP AI agent that can interact with the SQL Server using smart logic, and expose its functionality via a clean .NET Web API.

### âœ… Optional Add-On (for Advanced AI Logic Simulation):

> Additionally, explain how the AI agent can dynamically analyze user input and convert it into SQL or EF Core LINQ queries safely. (E.g., User says: "Show me all students in Grade 10", and the AI constructs and runs the appropriate query.)

Summary of Improvements:

|Original Prompt|Improved Prompt|
|---|---|
|Lacked grammar and clear structure|Structured format with bullet points|
|Ambiguous about project setup|Clear technologies and goals defined|
|Mixed ideas (AI + backend + auth) in one line|Organized requirements into parts|
|Didn't mention CRUD entities clearly|Included schema and CRUD targets|
|Vague on how AI fits in|Added an optional part to simulate AI logic|

### âœ… Improved Prompt (Professional Version)

> You are an AI agent responsible for developing an **MCP (Multi-Channel Platform) Server** for a **Hospital Management System**.
> 
> ### ðŸ”§ **Tech Stack & Tools**
> 
> - **Backend**: .NET Web API
>     
> - **ORM**: Entity Framework Core
>     
> - **Database**: SQL Server (with Stored Procedures, Views, Triggers, Nested Queries)
>     
> - **Frontend**: Angular 19 (latest version)
>     
> - **Architecture**: Clean Architecture (Separation of Concerns, Dependency Injection, Layered Design)

### Project Requirements

1. **Database Design**
    
    - Design a normalized SQL Server schema for hospital management: Patients, Doctors, Appointments, Departments, Billing, etc.
        
    - Use advanced SQL features:
        
        - Stored Procedures (e.g., register patient, discharge summary)
            
        - Views (e.g., patient-doctor summary)
            
        - Triggers (e.g., audit log on updates)
            
        - Nested Queries for analytics (e.g., doctors with most appointments per department)
            
2. **Backend (.NET Web API + EF Core)**
    
    - Implement a RESTful API using ASP.NET Core Web API.
        
    - Use **EF Core** for data access.
        
    - Structure the solution using **Clean Architecture** principles:
        
        - Domain Layer (entities, interfaces)
            
        - Application Layer (use cases, DTOs)
            
        - Infrastructure Layer (EF Core implementation)
            
        - API Layer (controllers, endpoints)
            
3. **Frontend (Angular 19)**
    
    - Build a responsive and dynamic UI for managing hospital operations.
        
    - Features: Patient registration, Doctor assignment, Appointment booking, Billing, Admin dashboard.
        
    - Communicate with the backend using REST APIs.
        
4. **Security & Authentication**
    
    - Implement **ASP.NET Core Identity** for authentication and role-based access (Admin, Doctor, Nurse, Receptionist).
        
    - Use JWT tokens for secure API access.

### âœ… AI Agent Simulation (Optional Enhancement)

> Simulate how an AI agent can:
> 
> - Interpret user input (e.g., "Show all doctors in cardiology department")
>     
> - Convert it into a safe, parameterized SQL or LINQ query
>     
> - Execute stored procedures or select from views as needed
>     
> - Return structured responses to the UI or API consumers
>

### ðŸŽ¯ Final Goal:

Develop a modular, scalable Hospital Management System using modern practices (Clean Architecture, Angular 19, EF Core) with intelligent data operations via AI-assisted logic.
