The `DELETE` statement is used to delete existing records in a table.

### DELETE Syntax

```sql
DELETE FROM _table_name_ WHERE _condition_;
```
**Note:** Be careful when deleting records in a table! Notice the `WHERE` clause in the `DELETE` statement. The `WHERE` clause specifies which record(s) should be deleted. If you omit the `WHERE` clause, all records in the table will be deleted!


## SQL DELETE Example

The following SQL statement deletes the customer "Alfreds Futterkiste" from the "Customers" table:


```sql
DELETE FROM Customers WHERE CustomerName='Alfreds Futterkiste';
```




## Delete All Records

```sql
DELETE FROM _table_name_;
Delete customers
```

## Delete a Table

To delete the table completely, use the `DROP TABLE` statement:

```sql
DROP TABLE Customers;
```
