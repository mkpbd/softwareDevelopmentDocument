**ER Model** stands for Entity Relationship Model is a high-level conceptual data model diagram. ER model helps to systematically analyze data requirements to produce a well-designed database. The ER Model represents real-world entities and the relationships between them.

## ER Diagrams Symbols & Notations

**Entity Relationship Diagram Symbols & Notations** mainly contains three basic symbols which are rectangle, oval and diamond to represent relationships between elements, entities and attributes. There are some sub-elements which are based on main elements in ERD Diagram. ER Diagram is a visual representation of data that describes how data is related to each other using different ERD Symbols and Notations.

**Following are the main components and its symbols in ER Diagrams:**

- **Rectangles:** This Entity Relationship Diagram symbol represents entity types
- **Ellipses :** Symbol represent attributes
- **Diamonds:** This symbol represents relationship types
- **Lines:** It links attributes to entity types and entity types with other relationship types
- **Primary key:** attributes are underlined
- **Double Ellipses:** Represent multi-valued attributes

## Components of the ER Diagram

This model is based on three basic concepts:

- Entities
- Attributes
- Relationships

**ER Diagram Examples**

For example, in a University database, we might have entities for Students, Courses, and Lecturers. Students entity can have attributes like Rollno, Name, and DeptID. They might have relationships with Courses and Lecturers.

## WHAT IS ENTITY?

A real-world thing either living or non-living that is easily recognizable and nonrecognizable. It is anything in the enterprise that is to be represented in our database. It may be a physical thing or simply a fact about the enterprise or an event that happens in the real world.

An entity can be place, person, object, event or a concept, which stores data in the database. The characteristics of entities are must have an attribute, and a unique key. Every entity is made up of some ‘attributes’ which represent that entity.

**Examples of entities:**

- **Person:** Employee, Student, Patient
- **Place:** Store, Building
- **Object:** Machine, product, and Car
- **Event:** Sale, Registration, Renewal
- **Concept:** Account, Course

Notation of an Entity

### Entity set

Student

An entity set is a group of similar kind of entities. It may contain entities with attribute sharing similar values. Entities are represented by their properties, which also called attributes. All attributes have their separate values. For example, a student entity may have a name, age, class, as attributes.

**Example of Entities:**

A university may have some departments. All these departments employ various lecturers and offer several programs.

Some courses make up each program. Students register in a particular program and enroll in various courses. A lecturer from the specific department takes each course, and each lecturer teaches a various group of students.  

## Relationship

Relationship is nothing but an association among two or more entities. E.g., Tom works in the Chemistry department.

![[100518_0621_ERDiagramTu4.webp]]
Entities take part in relationships. We can often identify relationships with verbs or verb phrases.

**For example:**

- You are attending this lecture
- I am giving the lecture
- Just loke entities, we can classify relationships according to relationship-types:
- A student attends a lecture
- A lecturer is giving a lecture.

## Weak Entities

A weak entity is a type of entity which doesn’t have its key attribute. It can be identified uniquely by considering the primary key of another entity. For that, weak entity sets need to have participation.


![[100518_0621_ERDiagramTu5.webp]]
## Attributes

It is a single-valued property of either an entity-type or a relationship-type.

For example, a lecture might have attributes: time, date, duration, place, etc.

An attribute in ER Diagram examples, is represented by an Ellipse

![[100518_0621_ERDiagramTu6.webp]]

|Types of Attributes|Description|
|---|---|
|**Simple attribute**|Simple attributes can’t be divided any further. For example, a student’s contact number. It is also called an atomic value.|
|**Composite attribute**|It is possible to break down composite attribute. For example, a student’s full name may be further divided into first name, second name, and last name.|
|**Derived attribute**|This type of attribute does not include in the physical database. However, their values are derived from other attributes present in the database. For example, age should not be stored directly. Instead, it should be derived from the DOB of that employee.|
|**Multivalued attribute**|Multivalued attributes can have more than one values. For example, a student can have more than one mobile number, email address, etc.|

## Cardinality

Defines the numerical attributes of the relationship between two entities or entity sets.

Different types of cardinal relationships are:

- One-to-One Relationships
- One-to-Many Relationships
- May to One Relationships
- Many-to-Many Relationships
![[100518_0621_ERDiagramTu7.webp]]

**1.One-to-one:**

One entity from entity set X can be associated with at most one entity of entity set Y and vice versa.

Example: One student can register for numerous courses. However, all those courses have a single line back to that one student.

![[100518_0621_ERDiagramTu8.webp]]
**2.One-to-many:**

One entity from entity set X can be associated with multiple entities of entity set Y, but an entity from entity set Y can be associated with at least one entity.

For example, one class is consisting of multiple students.

![[100518_0621_ERDiagramTu9.webp]]

**3. Many to One**

More than one entity from entity set X can be associated with at most one entity of entity set Y. However, an entity from entity set Y may or may not be associated with more than one entity from entity set X.

For example, many students belong to the same class.

![[100518_0621_ERDiagramTu10.webp]]
**4. Many to Many:**

One entity from X can be associated with more than one entity from Y and vice versa.

For example, Students as a group are associated with multiple faculty members, and faculty members can be associated with multiple students.

## How to Create an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)

Now in this ERD Diagram Tutorial, we will learn how to create an ER Diagram. Following are the steps to create an ER Diagram:

![[100518_0621_ERDiagramTu13.webp]]


### Step 1) Entity Identification

We have three entities

- Student
- Course
- Professor
![[100518_0621_ERDiagramTu14.webp]]

### Step 2) Relationship Identification

We have the following two relationships

- The student is **assigned** a course
- Professor **delivers** a course

![[100518_0621_ERDiagramTu15.webp]]
### Step 3) Cardinality Identification

For them problem statement we know that,

- A student can be assigned **multiple** courses
- A Professor can deliver only **one** course

![[100518_0621_ERDiagramTu16.webp]]

### Step 4) Identify Attributes

You need to study the files, forms, reports, data currently maintained by the organization to identify attributes. You can also conduct interviews with various stakeholders to identify entities. Initially, it’s important to identify the attributes without mapping them to a particular entity.

Once, you have a list of Attributes, you need to map them to the identified entities. Ensure an attribute is to be paired with exactly one entity. If you think an attribute should belong to more than one entity, use a modifier to make it unique.

Once the mapping is done, identify the primary Keys. If a unique key is not readily available, create one.

| Entity    | Primary Key | Attribute     |
| --------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| Student   | Student_ID  | StudentName   |
| Professor | Employee_ID | ProfessorName |
| Course    | Course_ID   | CourseName    |

### Step 5) Create the ERD Diagram

## Best Practices for Developing Effective ER Diagrams

Here are some best practice or example for Developing Effective ER Diagrams.

- Eliminate any redundant entities or relationships
- You need to make sure that all your entities and relationships are properly labeled
- There may be various valid approaches to an ER diagram. You need to make sure that the ER diagram supports all the data you need to store
- You should assure that each entity only appears a single time in the ER diagram
- Name every relationship, entity, and attribute are represented on your diagram
- Never connect relationships to each other
- You should use colors to highlight important portions of the ER diagram
