## Crow's Foot Notation

You can see various combinations of **ERD relations cardinalities** and their graphical notation in the picture below.

There are the following relations:

- **1 : 1** - one-to-one relationship
- **1 : 0..1** - one-to-zero or one relationship
- **1 : N** - one-to-many relationship
- **1 : 1..N** - one-to-one and more relationship
- **1 : 0..N** - one-to-zero and more relationship
- **N : N** - one-to-many relationship
- **1..N : 1..N** - one or more to one or more relationship
- **0..N : 0..N** - zero or more to zero or more relationship

You can create various combinations of cardinality. The cardinality is depicted on a connector end this way:

- **1 - one** - is depicted as a perpendicular line to the connector line.
- **0..1 - zero or one** - is depicted as a circle and a perpendicular line to the connector line. The circle is always nearer to the center of the relationship.
- **N - many** - is depicted as two sloping lines forming an arrow toward the center of the relationship (a reverse arrow).
- **0..N - zero or more** - has the same meaning as many, but it emphasizes that there can be also a zero cardinality. It is depicted as a circle and a reverse arrow.
- **1..N - one or more** - does not allow zero cardinality. It is depicted as a perpendicular line to the connector followed by a reverse arrow.

## Min-Max Notation

The **min-max notation** almost does not need any further explanation. The relationship is always depicted as a simple line. The cardinalities are expressed with the text definitions on the corresponding side.

## Bachman Notation

The same combination of cardinalities is depicted in the **Bachman Notation**. You can see various combinations of **ERD relation arrows** below:

- **1 : 1** - one-to-one relationship - depicted as full circles on both sides.
- **1 : 0..1** - one-to-zero-or-one relationship - depicted as a full circle on one side and an empty circle on the other side.
- **1 : N** - one-to-many relationship - depicted as a full circle on one side and an arrow on the other side.
- **1 : 1..N** - one-to-one and more relationship - depicted as a full circle on one side and an arrow and full circle on the other side.
- **1 : 0..N** - one-to-zero-or-more relationship - depicted in the same way as 1 : N.
- **N : N** - one-to-many relationship - depicted with arrows on both sides.
- **1..N : 1..N** - one-or-more-to-one-or-more relationship - depicted as full circles and arrows on both sides.
- **0..N : 0..N** - zero-or-more-to-zero-or-more relationship - depicted in the same way as N : N.
