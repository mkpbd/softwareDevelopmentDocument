## What is PostgreSQL?

PostgreSQL is an free open-source database system that supports both relational (SQL) and non-relational (JSON) queries.

PostgreSQL is a back-end database for dynamic websites and web applications.

## PostgreSQL History

PostgreSQL was invented at the Berkeley Computer Science Department, University of California.

It started as a project in 1986 with the goal of creating a database system with the minimal features needed to support multiple data types.

In the beginning, PostgreSQL ran on UNIX platforms, but now it can run on various platforms, including Windows and MacOS.


## Download PostgreSQL

To install PostgreSQL locally on your computer, visit the [installer by EDB](https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads), and download the newest version compatible with your operating system.

I will choose the newest Windows version:

## Start the Install

When the downloading is complete, double click the downloaded file and start the installation:

![[Pasted image 20250521121902.png]]
## Specify Directory

You can specify the location of PostgreSQL, I will go with the default choice:
![[Pasted image 20250521121929.png]]
## Select Components

To use PostgreSQL, you will need to install the PostgreSQL Server. In this tutorial we will also use the pgAdmin 4 component, and the Command Line Tools:

![[Pasted image 20250521122002.png]]
## Storage Directory

You can also choose where to store the database data, I will go with the default choice:

![[Pasted image 20250521122036.png]]
## Select Password

You will have to select a password to get access to the database. Since this is a local database, with no incoming connection, I will choose the password 12345678:

![[Pasted image 20250521122105.png]]


## Select Port

You can set the port the server should listen on, I will go with the default choice:
![[Pasted image 20250521123038.png]]
## Select Locale

Select the geographically location of the database server:
![[Pasted image 20250521123109.png]]
## Final Check

If everything looks OK, click 'Next' to continue:
![[Pasted image 20250521123129.png]]

## Start Installation:

Click 'Next' to start the installation:
![[Pasted image 20250521123145.png]]
## Installing

This can take a while, please wait.
![[Pasted image 20250521123159.png]]
## Complete!

Now you have installed PostgreSQL on your computer, and in the next chapter you will start using it!

# PostgreSQL Get Started

## Connect to the Database

If you have followed the steps from the [Install PostgreSQL](https://www.w3schools.com/postgresql/postgresql_install.php) page, you now have a PostgreSQL database on you computer.

There are several ways to connect to the database, we will look at two ways in this tutorial:

- SQL Shell (psql)
- pgAdmin 4

Both of them comes with the installation of PostgreSQL


## SQL Shell (psql)

SQL Shell (psql) is a terminal based program where you can write and execute SQL syntax in the command-line terminal.

### Open SQL Shell (psql)

You will find the SQL Shell (psql) tool in the start menu under PostgreSQL:

![[Pasted image 20250521140702.png]]

**Tip:** If you cannot find it, try searching for "SQL Shell" on your computer.

Once the program is open, you should see a window like the one below.

Insert the name of the server.

The suggested choice is [localhost], which is correct, press [Enter] to accept:

![[Pasted image 20250521142044.png]]
## Database

The suggested database is [postgres], which is correct, press [Enter] to accept:

![[Pasted image 20250521142107.png]]
## Port

The suggested port is [5432], which is correct, at least in my case, press [Enter] to accept:
![[Pasted image 20250521142121.png]]
## Username

The suggested username is [postgres], which is correct, at least for me, press [Enter] to accept:
![[Pasted image 20250521142136.png]]
## Password

Enter the password you chose when you installed the PostgreSQL database, my password is 12345678:

![[Pasted image 20250521142153.png]]

## Result

The result might look like an error, but if it shows `psql (15.2)` or any other version, and in the end you see the `postgres=#` command (and maybe a warning in between), then you have successfully connected to the database!
![[Pasted image 20250521142216.png]]
## Execute SQL Statements

Once you have connected to the database, you can start executing SQL statements.

Our database is empty, so we cannot query any tables yet, but we can check the version with this SQL statement:

```sql

SELECT version();
```

To insert SQL statements in the SQL Shell command, just write them after the `postgres=#` command like this:
![[Pasted image 20250521142318.png]]
Press [Enter] and the result should look like this:
![[Pasted image 20250521142334.png]]
## Remember the Semicolon

**Note:** Always end SQL statements with a semicolon `;`

SQL Shell waits for the semicolon and executes all lines as one SQL statement.

A multiple lines SQL statement is not executed before we include a semicolon at the end.
![[Pasted image 20250521142415.png]]
Now we are ready to create tables and fill them with data, but first we want to take a look at an application called pgAdmin 4.

# PostgreSQL - pgAdmin4

## Connect to the Database

In the previous chapter we learned how to connect to the database using the SQL Shell (psql) application, which is a command-based application that allows us to interact with the PostgreSQL database.

There is another application that comes built-in with the PostgreSQL installation, the pgAdmin 4 application, which also offers to interact with the database, but in a more user-friendly way.

## Start pgAdmin4

You will find the pgAdmin4 application in the start menu under PostgreSQL:
![[Pasted image 20250521142513.png]]
**Tip:** If you cannot find it, try searching for "pgAdmin4" on your computer.

Once the program has started, you should see a window like the one below, choose a master password, Since this is a local database that will run only on my computer, I will once again choose the password 12345678:
![[Pasted image 20250521142542.png]]
## pgAdmin4

Once you are inside the program, try to perform a simple SQL query.

To do that we have to navigate to the database.

Start by opening the [Servers] option in the menu on the left:
![[Pasted image 20250521142603.png]]
## Connect to Server

Now you need to enter the password that you created when you installed PostgreSQL, my password is 12345678:
![[Pasted image 20250521142618.png]]
## Find Database

Click on the [Database] option on in the menu on the left:
![[Pasted image 20250521142633.png]]
## Open Query Tool

You should find a database named `postgres`, right-click it choose the "Query Tool":
![[Pasted image 20250521142651.png]]
## Query Tool

In the Query Tool we can start executing SQL statements.
![[Pasted image 20250521142715.png]]
## Write SQL Statements

Our database is empty, so we cannot query any tables yet, but we can check the version with this SQL statement:

```sql
SELECT version();
```
To insert SQL statements in the Query Tool, just write in the input box like this:

![[Pasted image 20250521142749.png]]
## Execute SQL Statements

To execute a SQL statement, click the "Play" button above the input box:
![[Pasted image 20250521142807.png]]

## Result

The SQL statement is executed, and you can see the result in the "Data Output" area:
![[Pasted image 20250521142830.png]]
Now we have learned two ways of connection to a database and execute SQL statements on it:

- SQL Shell (psql)
- pgAdmin 4

In the next chapters we will use the SQL Shell application to create tables and insert data into the database.

If you want to use the pgAdmin interface instead, you can run all the SQL statements there, you should get the same result.
