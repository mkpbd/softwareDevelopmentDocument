In PostgreSQL, the keywords and operators `ALL`, `IN`, `EXISTS`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, and the use of subqueries in the `FROM` clause are powerful tools for writing nested queries. These allow you to filter, compare, or derive data across related tables like `customers`, `products`, `orders`, and `order_details`. Below, I’ll provide concise examples for each operator/keyword in the context of nested queries, focusing on their use with the same schema from your previous question. Each example will include a nested query, and I’ll ensure the `FROM` clause is used effectively in subqueries where applicable.

### Database Schema Recap
```sql
CREATE TABLE customers (
    customer_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    last_name VARCHAR(50),
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE
);

CREATE TABLE products (
    product_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    product_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    unit_price NUMERIC(10, 2) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE orders (
    order_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INT REFERENCES customers(customer_id),
    order_date DATE NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE order_details (
    order_detail_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    order_id INT REFERENCES orders(order_id),
    product_id INT REFERENCES products(product_id),
    quantity INT NOT NULL,
    price NUMERIC(10, 2) NOT NULL
);
```

### Sample Data
```sql
-- Insert customers
INSERT INTO customers (first_name, last_name, email)
VALUES 
    ('John', 'Doe', 'john.doe@example.com'),
    ('Jane', 'Smith', 'jane.smith@example.com'),
    ('Bob', 'Brown', 'bob.brown@example.com');

-- Insert products
INSERT INTO products (product_name, unit_price)
VALUES 
    ('Laptop', 999.99),
    ('Mouse', 29.99),
    ('Keyboard', 59.99);

-- Insert orders
INSERT INTO orders (customer_id, order_date)
VALUES 
    (1, '2025-05-01'), -- John
    (1, '2025-05-15'), -- John
    (2, '2025-05-10'), -- Jane
    (3, '2025-05-20'); -- Bob (no order details)

-- Insert order_details
INSERT INTO order_details (order_id, product_id, quantity, price)
VALUES 
    (1, 1, 1, 999.99),  -- John: 1 Laptop
    (1, 2, 2, 29.99),   -- John: 2 Mice
    (2, 3, 1, 59.99),   -- John: 1 Keyboard
    (3, 1, 2, 999.99);  -- Jane: 2 Laptops
```

### Nested Query Examples
Each example demonstrates one or more of `ALL`, `IN`, `EXISTS`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, with a focus on using subqueries in the `FROM` clause where applicable.

#### 1. Using `IN` with Subquery in `FROM`
**Example**: Find customers who placed orders containing a specific product (e.g., Laptop).
```sql
SELECT 
    first_name,
    last_name
FROM customers
WHERE customer_id IN (
    SELECT o.customer_id
    FROM orders o
    JOIN order_details od ON o.order_id = od.order_id
    WHERE od.product_id = (
        SELECT product_id
        FROM products
        WHERE product_name = 'Laptop'
    )
);
```

**Explanation**:
- The innermost subquery (`SELECT product_id FROM products ...`) gets the `product_id` for 'Laptop' (1).
- The subquery in the `FROM` clause joins `orders` and `order_details` to find `customer_id` values for orders containing that product.
- The outer query selects customers whose `customer_id` is in the subquery’s result.
- **Result**: John (order 1) and Jane (order 3).

#### 2. Using `EXISTS` with Subquery in `FROM`
**Example**: Find customers who have at least one order with a total value greater than $500.
```sql
SELECT 
    first_name,
    last_name
FROM customers c
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM (
        SELECT o.order_id
        FROM orders o
        JOIN order_details od ON o.order_id = od.order_id
        WHERE o.customer_id = c.customer_id
        GROUP BY o.order_id
        HAVING SUM(od.quantity * od.price) > 500
    ) AS high_value_orders
);
```

**Explanation**:
- The subquery in the `FROM` clause calculates the total value per order and filters for orders over $500.
- The `EXISTS` clause checks if such orders exist for the customer in the outer query.
- **Result**: John (order 1: $1059.97) and Jane (order 3: $1999.98).

#### 3. Using `ALL` with `>` and Subquery in `FROM`
**Example**: Find products with a unit price greater than all order item prices in a specific order.
```sql
SELECT 
    product_name,
    unit_price
FROM products
WHERE unit_price > ALL (
    SELECT od.price
    FROM order_details od
    WHERE od.order_id = (
        SELECT order_id
        FROM orders
        WHERE order_id = 1
    )
);
```

**Explanation**:
- The subquery in the `FROM` clause (`SELECT order_id FROM orders ...`) identifies order 1.
- The outer subquery retrieves prices from `order_details` for order 1 (999.99, 29.99).
- The main query selects products with `unit_price > ALL` (i.e., > 999.99).
- **Result**: No products, as no `unit_price` exceeds 999.99.

#### 4. Using `<=` with Subquery in `FROM`
**Example**: Find orders with a total value less than or equal to the average order value.
```sql
SELECT 
    o.order_id,
    o.order_date
FROM orders o
JOIN (
    SELECT order_id, SUM(quantity * price) AS order_total
    FROM order_details
    GROUP BY order_id
) AS order_totals ON o.order_id = order_totals.order_id
WHERE order_totals.order_total <= (
    SELECT AVG(total)
    FROM (
        SELECT SUM(quantity * price) AS total
        FROM order_details
        GROUP BY order_id
    ) AS avg_totals
);
```

**Explanation**:
- The subquery in the `FROM` clause calculates the total value per order.
- The subquery in the `WHERE` clause computes the average order value across all orders.
- The outer query selects orders where the total is `<=` the average.
- **Result**: Order 2 ($59.99), as it’s below the average order value (~$703.32).

#### 5. Using `>=` with Subquery in `FROM`
**Example**: Find customers whose total spending is greater than or equal to the average customer spending.
```sql
SELECT 
    c.first_name,
    c.last_name
FROM customers c
JOIN (
    SELECT 
        o.customer_id,
        SUM(od.quantity * od.price) AS total_spent
    FROM orders o
    JOIN order_details od ON o.order_id = od.order_id
    GROUP BY o.customer_id
) AS customer_totals ON c.customer_id = customer_totals.customer_id
WHERE customer_totals.total_spent >= (
    SELECT AVG(total)
    FROM (
        SELECT SUM(od.quantity * od.price) AS total
        FROM orders o
        JOIN order_details od ON o.order_id = od.order_id
        GROUP BY o.customer_id
    ) AS avg_spending
);
```

**Explanation**:
- The subquery in the `FROM` clause calculates total spending per customer.
- The subquery in the `WHERE` clause computes the average spending across customers with orders.
- The outer query selects customers with spending `>=` the average.
- **Result**: Jane ($1999.98), as her spending exceeds the average (~$1544.98).

#### 6. Using `<` with Subquery in `FROM`
**Example**: Find products cheaper than the cheapest product ordered by a specific customer (e.g., customer_id = 1).
```sql
SELECT 
    product_name,
    unit_price
FROM products
WHERE unit_price < (
    SELECT MIN(od.price)
    FROM order_details od
    JOIN orders o ON od.order_id = o.order_id
    WHERE o.customer_id = 1
);
```

**Explanation**:
- The subquery in the `FROM` clause (via the `JOIN`) finds the minimum price of products ordered by customer 1 (29.99 for Mouse).
- The outer query selects products with `unit_price < 29.99`.
- **Result**: No products, as no `unit_price` is less than 29.99.

#### 7. Using `>` with Subquery in `FROM`
**Example**: Find orders placed after the average order date for all customers.
```sql
SELECT 
    order_id,
    order_date
FROM orders
WHERE order_date > (
    SELECT AVG(order_date)
    FROM orders
);
```

**Explanation**:
- The subquery in the `FROM` clause (implicitly) calculates the average `order_date` across all orders (~2025-05-09).
- The outer query selects orders with `order_date >` this average.
- **Result**: Orders 2 (2025-05-15) and 3 (2025-05-20).

#### 8. Combining Multiple Operators with Subquery in `FROM`
**Example**: Find customers whose total order value exceeds all other customers’ average order value.
```sql
SELECT 
    c.first_name,
    c.last_name,
    customer_totals.total_spent
FROM customers c
JOIN (
    SELECT 
        o.customer_id,
        SUM(od.quantity * od.price) AS total_spent
    FROM orders o
    JOIN order_details od ON o.order_id = od.order_id
    GROUP BY o.customer_id
) AS customer_totals ON c.customer_id = customer_totals.customer_id
WHERE customer_totals.total_spent > ALL (
    SELECT AVG(od.quantity * od.price)
    FROM orders o
    JOIN order_details od ON o.order_id = od.order_id
    WHERE o.customer_id != c.customer_id
    GROUP BY o.order_id
);
```

**Explanation**:
- The subquery in the `FROM` clause calculates total spending per customer.
- The subquery in the `WHERE` clause computes the average order value for all other customers’ orders.
- The outer query selects customers whose total spending is `> ALL` other customers’ average order values.
- **Result**: Jane ($1999.98), as it exceeds all other customers’ average order values (John: ~$529.99, Bob: no orders).

### Notes
- **Performance**: 
  - Subqueries in `FROM` (derived tables) are often more readable and can perform better than correlated subqueries.
  - `EXISTS` is typically faster than `IN` for large datasets, especially with correlated subqueries.
  - `ALL` with comparison operators can be replaced with `MAX` or `MIN` for efficiency (e.g., `> ALL` can use `> (SELECT MAX(...))`).
- **Alternatives**: Consider Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for complex queries:
  ```sql
  WITH customer_spending AS (
      SELECT 
          o.customer_id,
          SUM(od.quantity * od.price) AS total_spent
      FROM orders o
      JOIN order_details od ON o.order_id = od.order_id
      GROUP BY o.customer_id
  )
  SELECT 
      c.first_name,
      c.last_name,
      cs.total_spent
  FROM customers c
  JOIN customer_spending cs ON c.customer_id = cs.customer_id
  WHERE cs.total_spent >= (
      SELECT AVG(total_spent)
      FROM customer_spending
  );
  ```
- **Indexes**: Use indexes on `customer_id` in `orders`, and `order_id` and `product_id` in `order_details` to optimize subqueries.
