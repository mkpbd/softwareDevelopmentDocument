In PostgreSQL, **JOIN** operations combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column. The main types of joins—`INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`, and `FULL JOIN`—control how rows are matched and whether unmatched rows are included in the result. Below, I’ll explain each join type, provide examples using the `customers`, `orders`, and `order_details` schema from your previous context, and demonstrate their behavior with nested queries where applicable.

### Database Schema Recap
```sql
CREATE TABLE customers (
    customer_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    last_name VARCHAR(50),
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE
);

CREATE TABLE orders (
    order_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INT REFERENCES customers(customer_id),
    order_date DATE NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE order_details (
    order_detail_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    order_id INT REFERENCES orders(order_id),
    product_id INT REFERENCES products(product_id),
    quantity INT NOT NULL,
    price NUMERIC(10, 2) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE products (
    product_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    product_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    unit_price NUMERIC(10, 2) NOT NULL
);
```

### Sample Data
```sql
-- Insert customers
INSERT INTO customers (first_name, last_name, email)
VALUES 
    ('John', 'Doe', 'john.doe@example.com'),
    ('Jane', 'Smith', 'jane.smith@example.com'),
    ('Bob', 'Brown', 'bob.brown@example.com');

-- Insert products
INSERT INTO products (product_name, unit_price)
VALUES 
    ('Laptop', 999.99),
    ('Mouse', 29.99),
    ('Keyboard', 59.99);

-- Insert orders
INSERT INTO orders (customer_id, order_date)
VALUES 
    (1, '2025-05-01'), -- John
    (1, '2025-05-15'), -- John
    (2, '2025-05-10'), -- Jane
    (3, '2025-05-20'); -- Bob

-- Insert order_details
INSERT INTO order_details (order_id, product_id, quantity, price)
VALUES 
    (1, 1, 1, 999.99),  -- John: 1 Laptop
    (1, 2, 2, 29.99),   -- John: 2 Mice
    (2, 3, 1, 59.99),   -- John: 1 Keyboard
    (3, 1, 2, 999.99);  -- Jane: 2 Laptops
```

### Join Types and Examples
Each join type is explained with an example, including a nested query where relevant to tie into your previous request.

#### 1. INNER JOIN
- **Description**: Returns only the rows where there is a match in both tables. Unmatched rows are excluded.
- **Syntax**: `TABLE_A INNER JOIN TABLE_B ON condition`

**Example**: List customers and their orders, including only customers with orders that have order details.
```sql
SELECT 
    c.first_name,
    c.last_name,
    o.order_id,
    o.order_date
FROM customers c
INNER JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
INNER JOIN order_details od ON o.order_id = od.order_id;
```

**Explanation**:
- `INNER JOIN` between `customers` and `orders` matches customers with their orders.
- Another `INNER JOIN` with `order_details` ensures only orders with details are included.
- **Result**: Shows John (orders 1 and 2) and Jane (order 3). Bob is excluded (no order details).

**Nested Query Example**:
```sql
SELECT 
    first_name,
    last_name
FROM customers c
WHERE customer_id IN (
    SELECT customer_id
    FROM orders o
    INNER JOIN order_details od ON o.order_id = od.order_id
);
```

**Explanation**: The subquery uses `INNER JOIN` to find `customer_id` values for orders with details, and the outer query selects matching customers (John and Jane).

#### 2. LEFT JOIN (LEFT OUTER JOIN)
- **Description**: Returns all rows from the left table and matched rows from the right table. Unmatched rows from the right table return `NULL`.
- **Syntax**: `TABLE_A LEFT JOIN TABLE_B ON condition`

**Example**: List all customers and their orders, including customers without orders or order details.
```sql
SELECT 
    c.first_name,
    c.last_name,
    o.order_id,
    o.order_date,
    od.quantity
FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
LEFT JOIN order_details od ON o.order_id = od.order_id;
```

**Explanation**:
- `LEFT JOIN` ensures all customers are included, even if they have no orders (e.g., Bob).
- The second `LEFT JOIN` includes `order_details`, with `NULL` for orders without details (e.g., Bob’s order 4).
- **Result**: Includes John (orders 1, 2 with details), Jane (order 3 with details), and Bob (order 4, `quantity` = `NULL`).

**Nested Query Example**:
```sql
SELECT 
    first_name,
    last_name,
    (
        SELECT SUM(od.quantity)
        FROM orders o
        LEFT JOIN order_details od ON o.order_id = od.order_id
        WHERE o.customer_id = c.customer_id
    ) AS total_quantity
FROM customers c;
```

**Explanation**: The subquery uses `LEFT JOIN` to sum quantities for each customer’s orders, including `NULL` for customers like Bob with no details (result: 0 or `NULL`).

#### 3. RIGHT JOIN (RIGHT OUTER JOIN)
- **Description**: Returns all rows from the right table and matched rows from the left table. Unmatched rows from the left table return `NULL`.
- **Syntax**: `TABLE_A RIGHT JOIN TABLE_B ON condition`

**Example**: List all order details and their associated orders and customers, including order details even if orders or customers are missing (unlikely in this schema due to foreign keys).
```sql
SELECT 
    c.first_name,
    c.last_name,
    o.order_id,
    od.quantity,
    od.price
FROM customers c
RIGHT JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
RIGHT JOIN order_details od ON o.order_id = od.order_id;
```

**Explanation**:
- `RIGHT JOIN` ensures all `order_details` rows are included, with matching `orders` and `customers`.
- In this schema, foreign keys ensure all `order_details` have an `order_id` and `customer_id`, so no `NULL` values appear for customers or orders.
- **Result**: Shows all order details (John: order 1, 2; Jane: order 3). Bob’s order 4 is excluded (no details).

**Nested Query Example**:
```sql
SELECT 
    product_name
FROM products p
WHERE product_id IN (
    SELECT od.product_id
    FROM orders o
    RIGHT JOIN order_details od ON o.order_id = od.order_id
    WHERE od.product_id = p.product_id
);
```

**Explanation**: The subquery uses `RIGHT JOIN` to ensure all `order_details` are considered, returning `product_id` values, which the outer query uses to select product names (Laptop, Mouse, Keyboard).

#### 4. FULL JOIN (FULL OUTER JOIN)
- **Description**: Returns all rows from both tables, with `NULL` in places where there is no match in the other table.
- **Syntax**: `TABLE_A FULL JOIN TABLE_B ON condition`

**Example**: List all customers and all orders, including customers without orders and orders without customers (if possible).
```sql
SELECT 
    c.first_name,
    c.last_name,
    o.order_id,
    o.order_date
FROM customers c
FULL JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id;
```

**Explanation**:
- `FULL JOIN` includes all customers and all orders, with `NULL` for unmatched rows.
- In this schema, all orders have a customer due to the foreign key, but customers without orders (none in this data) would appear with `NULL` for `order_id` and `order_date`.
- **Result**: Includes John (orders 1, 2), Jane (order 3), and Bob (order 4).

**Nested Query Example**:
```sql
SELECT 
    first_name,
    last_name
FROM customers c
WHERE customer_id IN (
    SELECT o.customer_id
    FROM orders o
    FULL JOIN order_details od ON o.order_id = od.order_id
    WHERE od.order_id IS NULL
);
```

**Explanation**: The subquery uses `FULL JOIN` to find orders without order details (e.g., Bob’s order 4), and the outer query selects the corresponding customer (Bob).

### Key Differences
- **INNER JOIN**: Only matched rows from both tables.
- **LEFT JOIN**: All rows from the left table, with `NULL` for unmatched right table rows.
- **RIGHT JOIN**: All rows from the right table, with `NULL` for unmatched left table rows.
- **FULL JOIN**: All rows from both tables, with `NULL` for unmatched rows on either side.

### Notes
- **Performance**: Use indexes on join columns (`customer_id` in `orders`, `order_id` and `product_id` in `order_details`) to optimize performance.
- **Nested Queries**: Joins can often replace nested queries for better readability and performance. For example, the `INNER JOIN` example could replace an `IN` subquery.
- **Use Case**: Choose the join type based on whether you need unmatched rows:
  - Use `INNER JOIN` for strict matches.
  - Use `LEFT JOIN` to keep all rows from the primary table.
  - Use `RIGHT JOIN` (less common) when prioritizing the right table.
  - Use `FULL JOIN` for complete inclusion of both tables.
