1.  table / Relation / Entity / Model 
2. rows/ tuples / records 
3. column / attribute 

 4. Collection of column  call Degree 
 5.  firtName, LastName  is Constraint / Domain 

 6. Supper key   
	 1. attrute or set of attrube by whtic we can identity each row uniquely 
	 2. Could be a sngle attribute or a set of attributes 
	 3. could have null valuest in the set 
	 4. It actually a superset 
		U_Id , (u_id , Name ),  (u_id, email), 
		email,  (emai, gender, age), (email, name),
   7.  Candidate Key 
	   1. Super key whose proper subset is not as super key 
	   2. Also called Minimal super key 
	   3. potential primary key : from the candidate keys, one is chosen as the primary key, However all candidate keys are potential choices for the primary key 
8.   Primary key 
	1. from the candidate keys, one key is chosen as the primary key for the table. the primray key is a specific candidate key that is selected as the main identity  for the records in that table 
	2. should be unique , not null and stable 
9. Foreign key 
	1. one table primary key  another table foreign key 

## Database Design 

SDLC  ( software development life cycle )

1. planning 
2.  analysis
3.  System Design  ( like , ui, ux,  database , )
4. building, 
5. testing 
6. Deployment 


## Purpose of Database Design 
	Structured organziation for efficenty data management and retriveal 
### Techniques of design Database

	1. Top-down  = start to db design 
	2. bottom-up  = alredy db design  completed previs 
	3. Hybrid Approch   we are  follow  top-down and bottom -up 

## Top-down Steps:
	step 1: determining Entites
	 step 2: Determinig attributes each Entity or table or model 
	 step 3: Relationships among entites Or tables or models

step-1: Determining Entites or tables 
 Student Enrolling in course
	Students can enroll in one or mutiple curses offerd on the platform 
	   Each enrollment represents a student's  prarticipation in a specific course.
	

 Course Abivaiable for enrollment
	 Courses are avaiable for student for enroll in .
	Each course can have mutiple student enrolled.

  Instructors taking course 
	  instructors could take one or more courses

Step-1 : determining entities 
	 1. place , person  or thing 
	 2. properties or attributes
	 3. unique identity
	 4. singular name 
	 5. should more one instance data 
	 6. 
	 7. 
Step-2: Determining Attributes 
	 * Should be related to the entity 
	 * should be atomic   / primary key 
	 * should have keys
Step-3:  Relationships Among entities Or Relationship Cardinality 

Relationships: connection between entity or table 

ex: instructor  Teachers student
